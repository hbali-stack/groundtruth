# gt_ae_block.sh — canonical `--ae` block for the GT runtime env.
#
# SCOPE / WIRED-STATUS (read before trusting this as de-drift):
#   This block is sourced by TWO callers today (Brief-F10 — the prior "ONE caller /
#   full.yml does not source it" claim was STALE):
#     • railway/codespace_deepswe_run.sh — sources it (~L280) + splices "${GT_AE_ARGS[@]}"
#       (~L291). This is the ONLY forwarding on the codespace witness path, so EVERY
#       member below MUST live in the array (that is why the Brief-F4 trio was added).
#     • .github/workflows/deepswe_full.yml — sources it (~L1052) + splices "${GT_AE_ARGS[@]}"
#       into GT_AE_ARM (~L1104), AND additionally passes its OWN explicit --ae set
#       (GT_VERIFY_EXECUTE / GT_EDIT_CHECK / GT_GATEWAY at ~L1081-1084, telemetry sinks,
#       etc.) — so full.yml forwards the members even where the array historically did not.
#   Still NOT sourcing it: .github/workflows/deepswe_trial.yml — its `pier run` passes NO
#   --ae / --mounts-json, so on the trial path the structural edit-risk axis (G03/G04) and
#   the G11 deep-telemetry trio (GT_RUNTIME_LEDGER / GT_HOOK_FIRE_COUNTS / full
#   GT_ORACLE_EVENTS sink) remain DARK. Making trial a TRUE single source is still OWED:
#   source this file from that run-step and splice "${GT_AE_ARGS[@]}" + a writable
#   --mounts-json.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (catalog gaps G03 + G04, HIGH):
#   pier does NOT blanket-forward the host's os.environ into the task container.
#   A plain host `export GT_FOO=1` is DROPPED. The ONLY verified forwarding path
#   is `pier run --ae KEY=VALUE` -> AgentConfig.env (cli/jobs.py) -> factory
#   extra_env -> agent._extra_env -> build_process_env -> exec(env=) ->
#   DockerEnvironment.exec appends `-e KEY=VALUE`. (See deepswe_full.yml "hole #5"
#   comment for the full trace.) The pier env whitelist in deepswe_gt_pier.yaml
#   (`environment.env`) carries ONLY PAGER/MANPAGER/LESS/PIP_PROGRESS_BAR/
#   TQDM_DISABLE — NO GT_* vars. So every in-container, env-gated GT producer
#   (structural edit-risk axis, oracle two-lane route, the 8-dp deep telemetry
#   sinks) runs with EMPTY GT env unless we pass `--ae` explicitly.
#
#   The TRIAL path (deepswe_trial.yml) historically passed NO `--ae` at all -> the
#   entire structural risk axis + oracle telemetry is dark there. This block is the
#   canonical definition that ELIMINATES that drift ON ANY CALLER THAT SOURCES IT —
#   today that is codespace_deepswe_run.sh AND deepswe_full.yml (see SCOPE above). It
#   does not retroactively de-drift a path that does not source it (deepswe_trial.yml).
#
# CONTRACT for callers:
#   1. Define GT_C_OUT before sourcing — the IN-CONTAINER directory the deep 8-dp
#      telemetry sinks write to. It MUST be a host-mounted, WRITABLE bind target
#      (so the records survive the container; gap G11). full.yml uses /gt_out;
#      the trial/codespace paths mount a host dir to /gt_out too. Defaults to
#      /gt_out if unset.
#   2. Optionally pre-set any GT_* var below in the environment to override the
#      default (e.g. GT_VERIFY_STRUCTURAL_RISK, GT_ORACLE_ROUTE).
#   3. `source` this file, then splice "${GT_AE_ARGS[@]}" into the `pier run`
#      command line.
#
# RANK-SAFETY NOTE (I2): none of these vars touch the localizer reach/RANK
# surface. They gate (a) the verify-axis structural edit-risk advisory, which the
# catalog confirms is a SCOPE/RISK substrate signal node-local-or-quiet, never a
# rank term, and (b) telemetry sink paths. No depth edge enters reach/rank via
# this block.

  #                        this edit" was deliverable only after verifying. 121 measured wrong_phase.
  #   GT_SCOPE_AT_SEARCH - consensus.scope (def_partition) fires on a SEARCH but was admissible only
  #                        in VERIFY. 34 suppressed / 7 delivered (83% lost).
  #   GT_COVERING_SCOPED - covering target lookup matched symbols GLOBALLY by bare name; `__init__`
  #                        matched 238 nodes on a real graph (LIMIT 20 kept 20 arbitrary ones).

  # declared context, so producer-identity partitioning made oracle eligibility 8/17; role fit
  # makes it 17/17.
  #
  # This is the ONLY lever here that can make the deterministic reasoning runtime ship a capsule
  # at all -- without it the oracle observes, reduces and produces evidence and then delivers
  # nothing, which is its state in every run to date. The seam reads this once and hands it to
  # the runtime; the temporal gate, coalition composer and capsule compiler all receive the same
  # value, and none of them reads the environment itself (replay must stay deterministic).
  #
  # Relaxes NOTHING else: role fit, causal connectivity, freshness, already-visible, supersession,

  # scans only gt_mini_patch.py while two of them are read in miniswe_provider_boundary.py.
  # Both guards were green while all three were dark.
