"""GT-augmented mini-swe-agent for Pier -- full 3-phase GroundTruth integration.

Extends Pier's MiniSweAgent to inject GroundTruth codebase intelligence into the
container at three points:

  Phase 1 -- graph.db at install time:
    Injects gt_hook.py + gt_mini_patch.py into the container.  If Go is available,
    builds gt-index from source and indexes the repo into /tmp/graph.db.  Falls
    back gracefully: gt_hook.py's AST-based self-index works without graph.db.

  Phase 2 -- L1 brief in instruction:
    If GT_GRAPH_DB + GT_REPO_ROOT env vars point to a pre-indexed graph.db on the
    HOST, generates a v1r brief and prepends it to the instruction in a
    <gt-task-brief> block.

  Phase 3 -- observation interception (post-edit / post-view):
    gt_mini_patch.py is loaded at mini-swe-agent interpreter startup via a .pth
    file in site-packages.  It monkey-patches the environment's execute() to
    classify commands as edit/view and append <gt-evidence> from gt_hook.py.

SUBSTRATE-CONSUME / PROOF mode (GT_PROOF_MODE=1, the leaderboard `deepswe_full.yml`
run) is FAIL-CLOSED, NO-FALLBACK on every path: the pinned substrate's
/gt_artifacts/graph.db is THE ONLY graph (no second in-container build), the §H
consumption witness RAISES (does not warn) on a hook != post-LSP hash mismatch, and
the brief is CONSUMED read-only from $GT_CERT_DIR/brief.txt — never regenerated host-
side. A missing/divergent substrate artifact HARD-STOPS the run (DeepSweAdapterError /
DEEPSWE_ADAPTER_FAIL), it never silently degrades. Outside proof mode the legacy
preindex/trial path stays best-effort / correct-or-quiet.

Control arm: set GT_BASELINE=1 to disable all GT injection.

    pier run -p deep-swe/tasks/<task> \\
        --agent-import-path artifact_deepswe.gt_agent:GTMiniSweAgent \\
        --model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash \\

    patterns you must match. Read those tags -- they are cross-file facts you
    cannot get from the file alone. They appear on their own; you do not call

# inside <gt-evidence> tags ... Read those tags"), which the 296-delivery audit showed is
# actively harmful: (a) it TRAINS the learned discount policy — half of the ~3% that were
# acknowledged named GT as a tool and dismissed it ("just the ground truth tool
# automatically checking"); and (b) it documents a <gt-*> tag grammar that no longer exists
# (payloads are tagless native since W10). This arm removes the tool-framing AND the
# retired-tag documentation and folds the expectation into ordinary engineering guidance:
# the environment surfaces compiler/test/reference diagnostics inline with command output,
# to be read as PART of that output — which is exactly what they are (GT rides the
# observation channel the model already reads). No self-identification, no "a tool appends",
# no "look for markers". The substantive guidance (preserve callers, preserve contracts,
# resolve a failing check on your own edit, verify with your own tests) is carried over
# verbatim in meaning. Boundaries / submit instructions live elsewhere and are untouched.
# Research: authority/confidence framing does NOT raise uptake (memo C1); only removing the
# discount-training cue can (native-channel mimicry, memo F1.3/F1.6).

    ## Codebase Intelligence Tool

    You have a codebase intelligence tool at /opt/gt/gt_hook.py that provides \
    cross-file analysis. Before editing a file, run:

        python3 /opt/gt/gt_hook.py understand <filepath> \\
            --root=$(cat /opt/gt/gt_root.txt) --quiet --max-lines=10

    This shows you information you CANNOT get by reading the file alone:
    - Which OTHER files call functions in this file and how they use the results
    - Which TEST files cover this module (so you know where to verify)
    - Rules that hold across ALL sibling methods (patterns you must follow)
    - Behavioral contracts (what functions read/write/return)

    Use the understand command on 1-2 key files before editing. Don't over-use it.

# Test the largest single signal).
#
# CONFIRMED from pier 0.2.0 source (the "confirm which" the plan demanded):
#   * pier's Verifier is TRIAL-level (trial.py:318 `Verifier(task=self._task, …)`);
#     the agent receives only (instruction, environment, context) — there is NO
#     `self._task` on the agent, so pier's verifier is NOT callable from run().
#   * the verifier's test script (tests/test.sh) lives HOST-side in the task dir
#     and is uploaded to /tests only AT VERIFY TIME (verifier.py:134-143) — it
#     does not exist in the container while the agent runs.
#   * test.sh applies the HIDDEN test patch (/tests/test.patch) and captures
#     model.patch from the worktree — running it mid-run would LEAK the hidden
#     test suite into the agent's context (leakage MUST be 0; no FAIL_TO_PASS /
#     hidden tests in product logic) and contaminate the model.patch artifact.

# GT_BASELINE) so a paired measurement compares the same harness.
#
# Oracle statelessness across retries (verified by construction): every
# attempt shells a NEW `mini-swe-agent` process in the container
# (mini_swe_agent.py:891-901 exec_as_agent), so gt_mini_patch's module-global
