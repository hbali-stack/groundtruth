"""AUDIT 2026-07-24 — EXECUTABLE dispatch-reachability proof for every gateway producer.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `newfile_precedent`/`GT_CHANGE_SURFACE` emitted 0 rows across all 4 tasks of run
30121930273 while being fully implemented, unit-tested, and *called* in the source. Reading the
source said "reachable"; the runtime said otherwise, because its only route (ZERO_ABSENT) sits
behind a gate demanding the agent fail the SAME search stem twice. Source-reading and unit tests
both MISSED it. Only driving the real dispatch exposes this class of bug.

So this test asserts the DISPATCH TABLE ITSELF, through the real `augment()` entry point that every
live observation traverses — the mapping from "what the agent just did" to "which producers get a
chance to speak." Producers are stubbed: the assertion is about REACHABILITY, not evidence content
(which needs a populated graph.db). A producer that silently stops being reachable is exactly the
failure this pins, and it is invisible to every other test we have.

# ARBITRATION HEADROOM. Reaching a producer is not enough under the <=1-dose law:
# the candidate must also WIN. change_surface ranks LOWEST in the miniswe priority
# table (new_file_destination 15, missing_role 22) against signature_mismatch 50
# and caller_break 48. So the edit-path trigger only ever delivers if the higher-
# ranked producers stay QUIET on a creation.
#
# They do — a brand-new file has no prior signature to break and no graph-indexed
# callers — but that is a PROPERTY OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATIONS, not a guarantee. If
# either ever starts emitting on a pure creation it would silently starve
# newfile_precedent forever, and the ledger would show "produced, not delivered"
# rather than anything that looks like a bug. Pin it.
