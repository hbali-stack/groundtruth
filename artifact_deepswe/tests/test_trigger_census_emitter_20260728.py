"""The trigger census: a measured denominator for every "this feature was dark" claim.

WHY.  A producer that was never ASKED and a producer that is BROKEN are the same silence
today, so "eleven of the seventeen features are dark" is not a gradeable statement.  This
records that a trigger's boundary OCCURRED — that the producer had an opportunity — which
turns a later non-delivery from an unfalsifiable absence into a measured negative.

THREE DESIGN DECISIONS PINNED HERE, each one a mistake avoided:

1. **Rows fire only for triggers whose boundary actually occurred.**  Emitting a row for
   every registered trigger on every observation would count correct-quiet as a missed
   opportunity — manufacturing the exact phantom darkness this exists to remove.
2. **The authority is ``required_event``, not ``deliver_by``.**  Eight registered
   evidence types disagree, including two of the 17 DIRECT.  Each row carries
   ``declared_deliver_by`` and ``deliver_by_overridden`` so a future reader that consults
   the wrong field is falsifiable from the artifact itself.
3. **Emitted where the semantic events are COMPLETE.**  The seam's own ``_semantic_arg``
   carries only three boundaries; ``_observe_semantic_events`` adds search_result /
   failed_search / failure_obs unconditionally and completes on first consumption.
   Reading the seam's list would have silently undercounted six of the nine.

ZERO MODEL BYTES.  Host-side ledger only, ``chars_delivered=0``, and ``outcome`` is
``"evaluated"`` — never ``"delivered"`` — so no delivery view can see these rows.  Default
OFF behind ``_inseam_metrics_on()``.
