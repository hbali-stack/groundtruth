"""Post-edit hook v5 -- graph.db-driven evidence with priority-ordered output.

DEAD — OpenHands is RETIRED (no live OH harness). NOT a live router on any
surface. The live per-turn / post-view producer is
``artifact_deepswe/gt_mini_patch.py`` (mini-swe). This module is retained ONLY
as a byte-parity test oracle (imported by 20+ tests) — keep it CALLABLE, never
route it.

(Historically invoked by the OpenHands PostToolUse hook on file_editor
operations.)
Priority order (stop when 300 tokens / ~1200 chars reached):
  1. Caller CODE lines (from graph.db edges.source_line -> read actual line from file)
  2. Sibling function pattern (from graph.db parent_id -> read sibling body snippet)
  3. Signature + return type (from graph.db nodes.signature)
  4. Test assertions (bonus only when available)

Falls back to legacy 5-family evidence when graph.db produces nothing.
Synced with L1 brief: briefed candidates get FULL evidence, 1-hop neighbors get
graph-aware evidence, unbriefed files get minimal (signature + nearest candidate).

Usage:
    python -m groundtruth.hooks.post_edit --root=/testbed --db=/tmp/gt_index.db --quiet --max-items=3

# combination of post-merge Layer-0 signals: resolution_method, trust_tier,

# (.claude/CLAUDE.md): dynamic per-edge categorical decision, hybrid 3-signal
# combination, confidence-gated at the FILTER level (no agent-facing label).
#
# Research basis:
#   - Anthropic "Writing Effective Tools" (2025): filter hard upstream,
#     verbatim downstream.
#   - Squeez arXiv 2604.04979 (2026): aggressive pre-display filtering.
#   - PyCG ICSE 2021: structural resolution methods (same_file, import,
#     type_flow) are the trustworthy categorical signals.
#
# Returns a SQL fragment (no leading AND) used in WHERE clauses on the
# `edges` table aliased as ``e``.
# Unified with the brief / curation map / localizer via the single shared
# constant DETERMINISTIC_RESOLUTION_METHODS (curation_map.py). Previously this
# hook-local tuple OMITTED ``lsp`` while the brief's set OMITTED
# impl_method/inherited/unique_method/return_type — three divergent fact-sets that
# disagreed on 15% of genuinely-resolved CALLS edges. One constant => every
# consumer treats the same structurally-resolved edges as FACTS, edge-for-edge.

    A "twin" is another function/method with the SAME name as the edited

    defines ``set_fields`` twice (e.g. once on ``ImportTask`` and once on
    ``SingletonImportTask`` in the same module), a fix to one almost always must
    be mirrored to the other. The fingerprint ``[SIMILAR]`` path missed this
    because two short identical methods can have divergent call-fingerprints.

    Generalized: keys only on name + path/class identity from graph.db — no

    homonym in a DIFFERENT file (that is a coincidental name clash, not a twin).
