"""fact_registry — the fact-to-decision registry (the spine; verifyandobserve.md §1).

RL-adherent delivery has ONE unifying rule that must hold BEFORE any producer renders a
byte: **every model-facing fact class is statically registered, and an UNREGISTERED fact
must never render.** This module is that registry — a pure, deterministic, LLM-free table
mapping each of the 11 §1 FACT inventory rows to the decision it is meant to change, the
observation boundary at which it is still useful, the surface + native renderer that carry
it, its dose ceiling, its freshness dependencies, and how a receipt / causal contribution
is graded for it.

WHY A REGISTRY (correct-or-quiet, gt_gt §24-§26 + the delivery law of §0):
    A GT fact is valuable only when it is CORRECT, ON-TIME (delivered at the last
    observation boundary where it can still change its intended decision), and RL-ADHERED
    (native channel). A fact with no registration has no declared decision, no deliver-by
    boundary, and no dose — so the delivery kernel cannot deliver it on-time or dose it.
    The safe default for such a fact is SILENCE: :func:`renderable` returns ``False`` for
    any class not in :data:`REGISTRY`, so the kernel's render path is gated
    (``if not renderable(fc): return``). This mirrors the fail-closed leak law of
    :mod:`groundtruth.runtime.evidence_envelope` — wrong/undeclared evidence is worse than
    none.

SCOPE: the registry is a static declaration of the fact-class contract. It does NOT render,
deliver, dedup, or enforce timing — those are the delivery kernel's (Gateway's) job. The
render GATE is now WIRED (Graph-F2, bounce 2026-07-10): :func:`groundtruth.runtime.gateway.
augment` drops any addition whose ``evidence_type`` is not :func:`renderable`. Because the
Gateway emits a FINER vocabulary than the 11 §1 keys, :data:`_EVIDENCE_TYPE_ALIASES` bridges
each shipped ``evidence_type`` to its canonical class so :func:`renderable` passes every
legit fact and blocks only a truly-unregistered type. Timing/dose/surface consumption of
:attr:`FactRegistration.deliver_by` / :attr:`~FactRegistration.max_dose` /
:attr:`~FactRegistration.surface` remains future work.

PURE · DETERMINISTIC · LLM-FREE · stdlib-only. No time, no randomness, no I/O.

EVENT VOCABULARY. The §1 table names the fine observation boundaries at which each fact is
still decision-useful (``task_start``, ``search_result``, ``file_view``, ``edit_result``,
``test_result``, ``submit``, and the composite boundaries ``first_view_edit``,
``failed_search``, ``failure_obs``). This is a FINER vocabulary than
:mod:`evidence_envelope`'s coarse ``preferred_event`` (search/view/edit/test/submit/step0);
the correspondence is noted per registration. For every §1 fact, ``earliest_event`` and
``deliver_by`` are the SAME boundary — these are facts ABOUT an action, useful only in the
observation that carries the action's result (there is no later boundary at which the fact
still changes the decision), so the last-useful boundary == the earliest one. The §1
deliver_by QUALIFIERS ("pre-edit", "interception", "transactional", "same X") are recorded
in per-registration comments; they refine the SAME canonical event.

# EVIDENCE-TYPE ALIASES (Graph-F2, bounce 2026-07-10) — the delivery-kernel's own
# vocabulary bridge.
#
# The Gateway emits a FINER-grained ``evidence_type`` vocabulary than the 11 canonical
# §1 fact classes (``def_ref_partition``/``name_fold``/``wrong_surface``/``body_concept``
# are all post_search ``def_partition`` variants; ``covering_verdict`` is ``covering_red``;
# ``cochange_partner`` is ``cochange_prior``; …). BEFORE this map, the registry keys and
# the shipped ``evidence_type`` strings DISAGREED, so wiring the render gate on the raw
# key (``if not renderable(fc): return``) would have silenced EVERY gateway fact. This
# table maps each shipped evidence_type -> its canonical registered fact class so
# :func:`renderable` passes every legit shipped fact and blocks only a truly-unregistered
# type. A dynamic ``missing_role:<role>`` is normalized to its ``missing_role`` base

# FRESHNESS — the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for per-evidence-type graph-surface dependencies.

# Freshness is genuinely PER-EVIDENCE-TYPE (finer than the 11 canonical classes): four
# gateway evidence_types share the canonical class ``def_partition`` yet ``body_concept``
# additionally depends on the body-FTS surface while its siblings do not, so collapsing to
# the canonical class would LOSE that distinction. This table (formerly the Gateway's private
# ``_FACTCLASS_FRESHNESS_SURFACES``, relocated here so there is ONE owner) is the operational
# truth; :func:`_self_check_executable` ties it back to the coarse §1 ``freshness_deps`` so it
# can no longer SILENTLY diverge. Tuple ORDER is load-bearing (the Gateway hashes the surfaces
# in order) — do not reorder.

# PATCH-bound classes: freshness is the working-tree PATCH, not any GRAPH surface (the
# registry ``freshness_deps`` name is ``patch_rev``). Produced AND delivered on the same
# event, so a graph change must never falsely stale them -> empty ``valid_until``.
# NOT a home for merely graph-INDEPENDENT classes. `_self_check_executable` enforces that
# every member carries a `patch_rev` registry dep ("patch-bound 'X' lacks a patch_rev registry
# dep"), so membership means "keyed to the patch", not "does not read graph.db".
#
# I tried adding `trace_frame` here on 2026-07-28 and the self-check rejected it immediately --
# correctly. Recording the attempt so it is not retried: `_produce_trace` (`gateway.py:2773`)
# genuinely opens no database (it is `parse_stack_traces` + `_to_repo_rel`, declaring
# `observed_substrates=("repository_paths",)`), so the PREMISE behind removing it from
# `FRESHNESS_SURFACES` is true -- but this is the wrong mechanism to express it, and there is
# no right one today.
#
# Consequence of the current state, stated plainly: an unmapped class falls through
# `if not surfaces or not subs: return graph_rev, graph_rev`, so `trace_frame` is now staled by
# the WHOLE-GRAPH composite -- including `properties`/`closure`/`cochanges`, which it never
# reads. That is MORE conservative than before, i.e. it over-expires rather than serving stale
# facts, which is the safe direction and matches the docstring's "over-conservative, never
# stale". It is a precision loss, not a correctness hole.
#
# The real residual is the CROSS-CHECK: `registry_graph_surfaces("trace_frame")` still returns
# ("nodes","edges","content_fts"), so the class claims graph deps it does not have, and the
# `_SURFACE_NARROWINGS` deletion means `_self_check_executable` no longer covers it -- it
# passes by EXCLUSION rather than by satisfaction. Fixing that properly needs either a
# GRAPH_INDEPENDENT_FACTCLASSES mechanism (returning `(graph_rev, "")` with no patch_rev
# requirement) or corrected canonical deps for the class.
