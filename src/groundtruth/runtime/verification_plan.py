"""VerificationPlan — the progressive check ladder (B1 verification, planner half).

WHY THIS EXISTS. The B1 verification-execution stack SELECTS the repo's own
covering test FILES that reach an edited symbol (``covering_runner.select_covering_tests``)
and RUNS them (``covering_runner.run_covering_tests``). Measured against the test
files that genuinely reference the edited symbol, that DIRECT selector's recall is
~0.019: tests almost never call the exact edited function — they call a
higher-level entry point that transitively reaches it. This module raises recall
WITHOUT re-implementing the selector, and it replaces hard-coded ``["pytest", ...]``
commands with repo-config-discovered ones, so verification generalizes across
repos/languages.

WHAT IT IS. A PURE planner: ``build_verification_plan`` reads graph.db + repo
config and emits a ``VerificationPlan`` — an ordered ladder of ``Check`` rungs
(syntax -> unit(targeted) -> integration(whole-suite)), each labelled with the
selection basis that produced it and a confidence that DEGRADES with derivation
distance (direct FACT covering > k=2 closure > test-dir convention). It executes
NOTHING itself. ``run_plan(plan, executor)`` delegates each rung to an EXISTING
runner (``edit_check`` for syntax, ``covering_runner`` for unit,
``test_runner.execute_test_command`` for a discovered whole-suite command) through
the frozen Wave-1 executor contract ``(cmd, cwd, timeout) -> (exit, out, err)``.

THE LAWS (inherited, non-negotiable):
- Deterministic / LLM-free / no network / no task-IDs / no gold labels. Same
  fixture -> byte-identical (sorted) plan.
- Correct-or-quiet + ADVISORY: nothing here blocks. A missing/ambiguous toolchain
  yields a kind-level UNKNOWN rung (``command=None``, ``confidence="unknown"``),
  NEVER a guessed command. Every helper fails toward quiet, never raises.
- THE FACT RULE: a covering / closure edge counts only when its
  ``resolution_method`` is in ``curation_map.DETERMINISTIC_RESOLUTION_METHODS``
  (imported — the ONE canonical set) AND ``confidence >= 0.7``; ``name_match`` is
  never a fact; ``is_test`` nodes are excluded per the leak law.
- GREEN redefined honestly (``green``): executed AND fresh (graph+patch revision
  match the plan) AND covers >= 1 named entity/obligation AND attributable-when-
  required AND the underlying verdict is a pass. A bare exit-0 with no coverage
  mapping is ``executed_unmapped`` — never green.

CANONICAL-SELECTOR DISCIPLINE. All test selection routes THROUGH
``covering_runner.select_covering_tests`` / ``build_covering_command`` (the ONE
file-scoped, leak-safe surface). This module never re-declares the covering SQL
and never touches the mini's name-scoped twin.

COMMAND-DISCOVERY CAPABILITY TABLE (config source -> whole-suite command +
confidence; conservative parsing; absent/unparseable sources silently skipped.
Confidence is MEDIUM only for CORROBORATED shapes — a pytest ini section, or a
package.json test script naming a known runner token; every other discovery is
LOW, because a `test` LABEL alone does not prove the command runs tests — the
measured FP classes include a Makefile `test:` target that DEPLOYED):

    pyproject.toml  [tool.pytest.ini_options] (required — bare [tool.pytest] is
                    IGNORED by pytest and is NOT a trigger)
                                             -> ["pytest"]  config:pyproject.pytest  medium
    pytest.ini      (present)                -> ["pytest"]  config:pytest_ini        medium
    setup.cfg       [tool:pytest]            -> ["pytest"]  config:setup_cfg         medium
    package.json    scripts.test — the npm-init placeholder ("no test specified")
                    or a bare echo with no runner token is NEGATIVE evidence:
                    discovery returns UNKNOWN (config:package_json_placeholder)
                    and BLOCKS the fallback, since `npm test` would run that very
                    placeholder. Otherwise:
                                             -> ["npm","test"]  config:package_json
                                                medium iff the script names a known
                                                runner token (jest/mocha/vitest/...),
                                                else low
    Makefile        a column-0 `test:` TARGET line only — never a `test :=`/`test =`
                    variable assignment, never a tab-indented recipe line
                                             -> ["make","test"]      config:makefile  low
    go.mod          (present)                -> ["go","test","./..."] config:go_mod   low
    Cargo.toml      (present)                -> ["cargo","test"]      config:cargo    low
    [tool.poetry.scripts].test  NOT a trigger: that table declares console-script
                    ENTRY POINTS, not a task runner (`test = "pkg.deploy:main"` is a
                    measured false positive).
    (none of the above)  -> repo_adapters extension fallback   extension_fallback  low
    (fallback empty)     -> UNKNOWN (command=None, confidence="unknown")

PER-KIND CAPABILITY (what a rung can and cannot verify):

    syntax        edit_check: py/js/go/rb parse-only checkers; ts/tsx/jsx/rs/java
                  are UNAVAILABLE (edit_check honesty table). Verdict "ok" requires
                  EVERY checkable target to parse; a mix of ok + unavailable is
                  "partial" (never green).
    unit          targeted covering over FACT edges + k=2 caller closure + test-dir
                  convention. Confidence degrades: fact_covering(high) >
                  closure_k2(medium) > test_dir_convention(low, INFO).
                  ATTRIBUTION HONESTY: only a fact_covering-basis PASS is
                  self-attributed — the FACT edge (deterministic method + conf>=0.7)
                  structurally proves the selected test reaches the edited symbol. A
                  closure-basis pass proves only 2-hop transitive reach (the pass
                  does not prove the edited code executed on that test's path); a
                  convention-basis pass proves nothing structural. Both carry
                  attribution_satisfied=False -> green() says "attribution_unmet":
                  an ADVISORY pass, never green.
    integration   the repo's whole discovered test suite — or UNKNOWN. A PASS needs
                  POSITIVE evidence (>=1 test parsed from the runner's own output,
                  mirroring covering_runner._classify_one); a clean exit with ZERO
                  tests parsed is "executed_no_tests", NEVER green (the measured
                  attack: a discovered `make test` that deploys and exits 0).
    type|build|   NOT emitted unless a future obligation/config names a sound command
    property|e2e  (correct-or-quiet: no cheap, sound, language-agnostic discovery).

MEASURED RECALL HONESTY (gt_selection_pr --planner, 2026-07-10). The label-tier
recall win (micro-R 0.52 on the signature dataset vs 0.0 direct-covering) is
carried by the TEST-DIR CONVENTION lever: all 13 label-tier true positives were
selection_basis=test_dir_convention; closure_k2 contributed 0 predictions and 0
hits on that tier (grep tier: 33 convention TPs vs 10 closure TPs; closure
precision ~0.079). CAVEAT (F10): the label tier is convention-biased BY
CONSTRUCTION — a commit changing X.py predictably touches tests/test_X.py — so it
inflates exactly the convention lever. The closure lever must be judged on the
grep tier / future SHA-matched sets, where it is currently weak. No number here
may be cited as closure credit.
