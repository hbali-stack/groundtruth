    C5. `content_hash` is a derived property recomputed from the live class definition on
    every access (`_canonical_data` walks `asdict`, with no allowlist and no omit-if-default),
    so ADDING A FIELD to `CanonicalResult` or `CanonicalEvent` changes the recomputed digest
    of rows that were ALREADY WRITTEN. `EventStore.events` then compares the recomputed hash
    to the stored one, they differ, and it raises.

    Before this class existed the failure surfaced as `"event content hash/tamper mismatch"`,
    which `gt_mini_patch._record_fault` maps to `FaultCode.CAUSAL_EVENT_GAP` -- a member of
    `CORE_CORRUPTION_CODES` -- so an ordinary schema evolution was reported as TAMPERING and
    silently isolated the canonical observer for the rest of the attempt. A compat break that
    presents as an attack is the worst possible diagnosis: it sends the reader hunting for
    corruption that does not exist while GT quietly produces nothing.

    Subclasses `EventIntegrityError` deliberately, so every existing `except` clause keeps
    catching it and no caller regresses; only the MESSAGE and the type narrow.

#
# WHY IT EXISTS. `_evidence_record_from_json` reads optional fields with `raw.get(name, ())`,
# so a row written BEFORE a field existed rehydrates byte-identically to a row whose field is
# legitimately empty. For `observed_substrates` that is not cosmetic: the substrate gate holds
# any record that cannot evidence its own substrate, which is CORRECT for the second case and
# undiagnosable for the first. Recording which schema wrote each row separates them.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it does not "unhold" legacy rows. Substrate evidence that was never
# recorded cannot be recovered, and holding such a record is correct-or-quiet. The gate stays
# strict -- weakening it re-opens cross-record substrate lending. This makes the condition
# DIAGNOSABLE and makes an unknown future schema fail LOUDLY instead of being silently misread.

# this literal was hand-duplicated in FOUR places -- `reasoning_runtime` (the writer),
# `runtime_attestation.py:580` and `gt_feature_metrics.py:1843` (readers that RECOMPUTE the
# hash to verify it), and a provider-boundary test. Bumping only the writer silently broke
# every reader: 8 runtime_attestation tests and 3 canonical-ack collector tests went red
# because they recomputed a v2 digest and compared it to a v3 one.
#
# That is the same "two things that must agree by hand" defect the metrics work has been
# unpicking all week, sitting inside the mechanism whose whole job is to make disagreement
# detectable. A hash label that four files must keep in sync manually is not a version -- it
# is four versions that happen to match today.

    # AN ORPHANED OUTCOME IS NOT CORRUPTION.
    #
    # The table splits into OPENING transitions, which admit None (EXACT_SEARCH,
    # FOCUSED_SYMBOL_VIEW, EDIT_PROPOSED), and OUTCOME transitions, which require a
    # hypothesis to already exist (VALIDATION_SUPPORT, UNCHANGED_FAILURE_AFTER_EDIT,
    # VERIFIED_COUNTEREVIDENCE, ABANDON_TARGET, SUPERSEDING_HYPOTHESIS). But GT is never
    # TOLD the agent's hypotheses -- it infers them from observations. When the opening
    # observation is missed or classified as something else, the outcome arrives orphaned
    # with `current is None`.
    #
    # Measured on run 30276041709, where the fault detail named it in one line:
    #   observe_failed:StateIntegrityError:illegal hypothesis transition None via
    #   VALIDATION_SUPPORT
    # 52 compile attempts, all at iteration 0, then that fault, then dark_fallback forever.
    # The agent had gone find -> grep -> run a repro script: a validation outcome before GT
    # had opened anything for that subject. `append_event` persists before reducing, so the
    # raise classifies REDUCER_INVARIANT_VIOLATION (a CORE corruption code), replay
    # re-reduces the same event, and the observer is isolated for the whole attempt -- GT
    # loses its entire timing authority because the agent validated something GT had not yet
    # formed an opinion about.
    #
    # Skip the transition instead. Nothing transitions and NO node is invented, so the
    # invariant this check protects -- the machine never enters an illegal state -- holds
    # exactly as before. A mismatch from a REAL state still raises below: that means the
    # graph itself is inconsistent, which IS corruption.
    # A RE-OBSERVATION IS NOT A TRANSITION, AND NOT CORRUPTION EITHER.
    #
    # The ACTIVE+FOCUSED_SYMBOL_VIEW widening above fixed ONE cell. It is one of EIGHT where
    # the signal's target state IS the state the node is already in, and the other seven still
    # raise. Measured on the live producer surface: `_OUTCOME_SIGNAL_KIND` is the only thing
    # that constructs an OperationalSignal and it emits 4 of the 8 kinds, so the reachable grid
    # is 4x4 = 16 cells -- and 8 of those 16 raise today. Two are ordinary agent behaviour:
    #   CANDIDATE + EXACT_SEARCH        -- grep the same symbol twice
    #   SUPPORTED + VALIDATION_SUPPORT  -- run a passing test twice
    # and the whole SUPPORTED row raises, so once a passing test moves a hypothesis to
    # SUPPORTED, no signal the producer can emit for that subject avoids quarantine. A passing
    # test makes its own subject radioactive for the rest of the attempt.
    #
    # Same root cause as `orphaned_outcome` below and as the run-30390877219 crash: GT is never
    # TOLD the agent's hypotheses, it INFERS them from observations, so the same observation
    # legitimately arrives more than once. Widening each cell's allowed-from set one at a time
    # (what the FOCUSED_SYMBOL_VIEW fix did) also mints a fabricated self-transition per repeat.
    # No production code reads `.transitions` -- but a transition ledger whose entries are not
    # transitions is a bad thing to keep, and `transitions` is inside `canonical_json()` and so
    # inside `graph_hash`.
    #
    # NOT a claim that this makes `graph_hash` stable across repeats -- it does not, and an
    # earlier draft of this comment said otherwise. `sequence`, `last_source_event_sequence`
    # and `source_event_ids` are ALSO graph fields, and the reducer requires
    # `signal.sequence == graph.sequence + 1`, so ten repeat observations produce ten distinct
    # graph hashes both before and after this change. What changes is WHAT the hash encodes,
    # not how many values it takes.
    #
    # So: classify `current == target` as a state-preserving UPDATE. Nothing transitions, no
    # node is invented, no self-transition is recorded, and the edge block below still runs
    # because new counterevidence against an already-CONTRADICTED hypothesis is real
    # information. A mismatch from a state that is genuinely not the target still raises: that
    # means the graph itself is inconsistent, which IS corruption.
    #
    # A RE-OBSERVED OPENING IS NOT CORRUPTION EITHER, AND IT MUST NOT REGRESS THE STATE.
    #
    # `state_preserving` closed the six self-target cells. FIVE live-reachable cells still
    # raised, four of them an OPENING kind arriving at a state further along than the one it
    # opens (probe, 2026-07-28, over the whole `_OUTCOME_SIGNAL_KIND` 4x4 surface):
    #   ACTIVE    + EXACT_SEARCH         -- view a symbol, then grep it again
    #   SUPPORTED + EXACT_SEARCH / FOCUSED_SYMBOL_VIEW / EDIT_PROPOSED
    #                                    -- a test passed, then search/view/edit that surface
    # The whole opening half of the SUPPORTED row raised, so ONE passing test made its own
    # subject radioactive for the rest of the attempt.
    #
    # The table models GT's INFERENCE of the agent, not a structural invariant of the graph.
    # This function is the SOLE writer of `hypothesis_state` (the two `replace`/append sites
    # below and the SUPERSEDING related node); every graph reaching it was folded from
    # `ReasoningGraph.initial` over committed events -- `reduce_reasoning_event`,
    # `replay_reasoning_signals`, `recovery_assurance._RuntimeProjection`. No path deserialises
    # a node state from bytes. So `current` is always a state this function itself wrote, and an
    # opening that cannot advance from it means GT's inference lags the agent -- not corruption.
    #
    # Restricted to OPENINGS, derived as `None in allowed` (EXACT_SEARCH, FOCUSED_SYMBOL_VIEW,
    # EDIT_PROPOSED). The five OUTCOME kinds make CLAIMS about hypothesis progress -- validated,
    # weakened, contradicted, abandoned, superseded -- and their allowed-from sets encode which
    # claims are coherent; admitting those too would make the raise below unreachable for all 64
    # cells, i.e. dead code, and 18 outcome cells still raise because of this restriction.
    #
    # SKIP, never widen. Widening was right for the FOCUSED_SYMBOL_VIEW fix above because ACTIVE
    # is its target. It is wrong here: giving EXACT_SEARCH `SUPPORTED` as a legal source would
    # drive a validated hypothesis BACKWARDS to CANDIDATE, and EDIT_PROPOSED from SUPPORTED back
    # to ACTIVE, destroying observed execution truth because the agent grepped something twice.
    # Nothing transitions and no node is invented, so the invariant this check protects holds.
    #
    # Openings never reach the edge block below -- only VERIFIED_COUNTEREVIDENCE and
    # SUPERSEDING_HYPOTHESIS append edges, and neither admits None -- so a skipped opening
    # cannot fabricate an edge. Subject rebinding is still refused above, so this does NOT
    # become "any signal may hit any node".
    #
    # NOT FIXED HERE: `CANDIDATE + VALIDATION_SUPPORT` (grep a symbol, then a test passes on it)
    # is live-reachable and still raises. It is an OUTCOME, so this rule does not reach it, and
    # its repair -- widening VALIDATION_SUPPORT to `{CANDIDATE, ACTIVE}`, a monotone advance to
    # an already-reachable state -- is blocked by the explicit pin on that exact cell in

# agent edits (i.e. every real task) the coalition could never complete.

# returns False for an unmapped dependency (fail-closed), so a deletion would make the record
# permanently stale -- the opposite of the intent.

# mutable runtime state and MUST retire when the repository moves; exempting them would let
# GT serve edit-derived evidence about a file that has since changed -- stale evidence

    * ``corrective_boundary`` -- the last boundary at which the fact is still useful as a

    :meth:`resolve` NEVER returns ``CLOSED``. A window that has passed routes to

# THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for how the decision-window marker projects out of a generation
# identity. Exported 2026-07-28 because it was a hand-duplicated RULE, not a shared one: the
# WRITER (`_evidence_generation_projection` below) normalized the field, while the offline
# READER (`runtime_attestation._evidence_generation_projection`) compared it RAW. The runtime
# therefore accepted a re-offer whose window had advanced, wrote both journal rows, and the
# reader then rejected the identical history as EVIDENCE_GENERATION_REWRITTEN.
#
# Observed on run 30390877219, all 5/5 tasks, always the same record: the task-start
# `obligations` capsule (feature_id="obligations", mandatory_reason=TASK_OBLIGATION), whose
# window advanced from "" to a real GT-W-* marker between journal seq 1 and 2. The reject made
# `delivered_count` 0 and `integrity_ok` false, which dropped
# `canonical_runtime_attestation_integrity` from the required inputs and marked EVERY task
# uncitable. Nothing about the delivery was wrong; the two halves of one rule disagreed.
#
# WHY A SENTINEL RATHER THAN "": the marker is runtime-owned scheduling state, but the
# obligations task-start record must never project-equal a record that legitimately carries no
# window at all. Two constants keep those distinguishable while erasing the volatile value.
#
# Every consumer must IMPORT this; a new hand-written copy of the conditional is a defect.

    ``True``: eligibility follows the roles the decision actually declares it needs, and
    ``decision_context`` becomes provenance. Measured motivation -- under the partition,
    12 of 25 required/useful role slots have no reachable carrier and PATCH_CONSTRUCTION
    can never hold more than ``{caller_contract, obligations}``, so most of what the
    ``useful_roles`` tables ask for is unreachable.

    ``acquired_subjects`` is native WorkState truth, not provider visibility. It
    suppresses only target-identity evidence whose normalized repository subject
    was already viewed or edited; additive contract and validation evidence about
    the same file remains eligible.

    This relaxes NOTHING else. Role fit, connectivity, freshness, already-visible,
    supersession, duplicate-claim dedup, the token budget and -- decisively --
    decision-completeness all still apply: a coalition without a record carrying the
