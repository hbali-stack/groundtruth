"""Which fact triggers were EVALUATED on an observation — the denominator for "dark".

WHY THIS EXISTS.  A GT feature that produced nothing is today indistinguishable from a
feature whose trigger never occurred.  Both look like silence, so "eleven features are
dark" cannot be graded: correct-quiet and broken read identically.  The fix is a
denominator — a host-side row per (observation, evidence_type) recording that a trigger
was evaluated and what the observation actually contained.  This module is the pure,
importable half: it answers *which triggers exist and when each one fires*, derived from
the registry, never hand-listed.

THE AUTHORITY IS ``required_event``, NOT ``deliver_by``.  This is the single most
important thing here and it is easy to get wrong — I did, on the first design.
``fact_registry`` maps evidence types to a canonical class BY DECISION, not by TIMING, so
a finer evidence type can deliver at a different boundary than its class:

    caller_break             deliver_by=file_view      required_event=edit_result
    caller_contract_search   deliver_by=file_view      required_event=search_result
    brief_localization       deliver_by=search_result  required_event=task_start
    trace_frame              deliver_by=search_result  required_event=failure_obs
    missing_role_postcreate  deliver_by=failed_search  required_event=edit_result
    obligation_unexercised   deliver_by=task_start     required_event=test_result
    coherence_collapse       deliver_by=failure_obs    required_event=edit_result

Seven of eighteen registered evidence types disagree, including two of the 17 DIRECT.  A
``deliver_by``-keyed enumerator would silently attribute those to the wrong observation —
manufacturing phantom opportunities (a trigger recorded as evaluated when the producer was
never asked) and phantom darkness (a producer that fired with no opportunity row).  Both
are worse than no row at all.

THE CLASS NAME IS NOT IN ITS OWN GRAIN.  ``evidence_grain_for(fc)`` returns the FINER
identifiers that collapse to ``fc``; it never includes ``fc`` itself.  Enumerating only
the grain gives ``submit_refusal`` and ``syntax_result`` — two of the 17 DIRECT — ZERO
triggers, because their grains contain only producer names with no registration.  So the
enumeration is ``{class} | grain``, filtered to what actually registers.

TWO BOUNDARIES ARE GENUINELY UNOBSERVABLE, and are marked rather than omitted:

* ``task_start`` — the step-0 brief reaches the model by raw string prepend, not as a tool
  observation at all, so no semantic event can carry it.
* ``first_view_edit`` — has NO producer anywhere in the runtime.  (A gateway comment
  claims ``patch_delta`` realizes it; that comment is false — ``patch_delta`` stamps
  ``edit_result``.)  Its only class, ``cochange_prior``, is an internal ranking prior that
  is never delivered as a fact.

Marking beats omitting: an omitted trigger is indistinguishable from one that was never
considered, which is the exact defect this module exists to remove.
