"""GT Gateway kernel (G1 + G2-pure) — the mini-swe-agent single-surface completer.

One interception point (the tool-observation constructor), one normalized event, one
acquisition-outcome classifier, existing producers, one dedup chain. Every agent
action (search / view / edit / test / submit) is completed with deterministic FACTS
inside the SAME observation the model already reads.

This module is PURE, DETERMINISTIC, and LLM-free. It **replicates** the semantics of
``artifact_deepswe/gt_mini_patch.py`` (post_search parse + the listen lattice) WITHOUT
importing it — importing gt_mini_patch executes runtime monkeypatches. The search-command
parse here is proven byte-equivalent to that module's ``_search_pattern`` by the golden
corpus in ``tests/runtime/test_gateway.py`` (re-derived from ``test_post_search.py``).

Governing laws (mostly pre-existing; the sub-flag kill-switches below are new, 2026-07-12 —
they make this line's long-standing claim true rather than aspirational):
  * Master flag ``GT_GATEWAY`` — unset/0 => :func:`augment` returns ``[]`` immediately.
  * Producer sub-flags are KILL-SWITCHES at their :func:`augment` call site — default-ON,
    ``GT_CHANGE_SURFACE`` for W-A / ``GT_PATCH_DELTA`` for W-C: unset => the producer fires
    exactly as if the flag did not exist (byte-identical); the literal string ``"0"`` => that
    call site is skipped, the OTHER producer unaffected. This is a DIFFERENT polarity from the
    ``_xxx_on()`` ENABLEMENT flags below (``GT_GATEWAY``, ``GT_REGISTRY_ENFORCE``, ``GT_LOC_RESLOT``,
    ...), which default OFF and require an explicit ``"1"`` to arm a capability. The SAME two env
    var NAMES are also read, with THAT (default-OFF, enablement) polarity, one layer further down
    by the producers' own DOWNSTREAM engines (``change_surface._flag_enabled``,
    ``patch_delta._flag_on``) — those are separate, pre-existing ``rl_profile`` Profile-2/SM-5
    members gating the ENGINES themselves; this call-site kill-switch is additional and needs no
    new ``rl_profile``/``gt_ae_block.sh`` wiring (the var already reaches the engine unchanged).
  * Correct-or-quiet: wrong evidence is worse than none; every ambiguity abstains.
  * ONE PAYLOAD CONTRACT: every produced fact is an
    ``evidence_envelope.EvidenceEnvelope`` (the canonical contract; the former
    ``Addition`` capsule was REPLACED at reconciliation, option (b), 2026-07-10).
    Field mapping: ``fact_kind`` -> ``evidence_type``, ``body_lines`` -> ``payload``,
    ``evidence`` -> ``provenance``, the F1 symbol -> ``fact_id``. Every envelope
    :func:`augment` ships passes ``evidence_envelope.validate`` (a violating
    envelope is DROPPED fail-closed, never delivered).
  * LEAK LAW: no envelope may carry a test-file path/name in its ``target``,
    ``payload``, OR ``provenance``. The single predicate :func:`_is_leaky`
    (== ``not is_deliverable``) gates the target and every provenance row; a
    belt-and-braces scan in :func:`_mk_add` drops any PAYLOAD line carrying a leaky
    path-shaped token; covering-test bodies are additionally routed through the
    EXISTING identity firewall ``native_render.render_covering_failure_native``
    (Format D — never a second scrubber). On any uncertainty a path is treated as
    a test and dropped. ``validate`` law (a) re-checks target+provenance.
  * Need gate: every envelope carries the CANONICAL deterministic ``dedup_key``
    (``evidence_envelope.derive_dedup_key``: producer, evidence_type, target,
    fact_id=the F1 symbol, content=the shipped payload+provenance) — the symbol
    keeps two DISTINCT facts from colliding on a shared def file, and the content
    component lets the SAME symbol re-fire when its def-set changes (freshness).
    STAMP-AT-SEAL (bounce 2026-07-10): :func:`augment` only READS
    ``state.delivered_keys`` for suppression; the DELIVERY COMMIT (the seam's seal
    step — ``adapters.miniswe.seal_delivery(dedup_chain=...)``) stamps the key when
    the bytes are actually appended. So a repeated event yields ``[]`` only once the
    fact was DELIVERED; a produced-but-dropped fact (arbitration loss / leak-guard /
    law-8 budget) is deferred and re-offered, never destroyed.

Rendering is intentionally NOT this module's job: an envelope is a minimal decision
capsule (target + change context + facts + provenance). No ``<gt-*>`` tags,
no agent-facing string assembly beyond deterministic ``file:line`` row formatting.

    C12. The relevance gate is a `subject:` intersection against work-state focus, so evidence is
    releasable only when its subject is a string already in focus. `_resolved_search_symbols` put
    the graph-validated search OPERAND into focus, which un-held SYMBOL-subject records
    (`def_partition`). It did nothing for FILE-subject records: `localization`'s subject is the
    ranked top FILE, which the agent has by definition NOT opened, because naming an unopened file
    is the entire feature (CLAUDE.md §3). So the gate stayed empty exactly when localization had
    something to say.

    This closes that gap WITHOUT relaxing the gate. The agent searched `parse_url`; the graph says
    `parse_url` is defined in `src/pkg/urls.py`; therefore evidence naming `src/pkg/urls.py` is
    evidence about what the agent is working on. That is a real, deterministic connection — the
    same graph relation the product is built on — not a widening of the bar. Evidence unconnected
    to anything focused still intersects nothing and is still HELD.

    BOUNDED ON PURPOSE. A name resolving to more than ``max_files`` definition sites is AMBIGUOUS
    and yields () rather than putting several unrelated files into focus: focus drives an
    intersection, and inventing relevance turns a quiet feature into a wrong one. Same reasoning,
    and the same 3-file bound, as `_resolve_symbol_defs`.

    The row predicate is character-for-character the one `defined_symbols_for_file` and
    `_resolved_search_symbols` use (`is_test=0`, `start_line>0`, `label IN _DEF_LABELS`). That is
    load-bearing: those two resolvers once disagreed on `start_line`, and a focus writer that
    admits a definition the focus reader cannot see re-creates the same class of ghost.

    GT_SCOPE_NATIVE is the mediator that shapes the ``localization`` FACT class with a
    certified must-ALSO-touch scope constraint. Its decision was DARK: the mini-seam
    splice (:func:`gt_mini_patch._splice_search_scope`) records the APPLIED/delivered
    receipt ONLY when it actually appends a scope block, so the FAR more common
    correctly-SILENT outcome — the graph certification ran and found NO qualifying
    cross-file neighbour above the confidence floor — produced no typed
    ``control.participation`` row at all, leaving the terminal unable to witness that
    the control ran and correctly withheld.

    This records exactly that NO_EFFECT half, keyed on the GENERAL condition (an empty
    certified selection), never on any task/repo/anchor. The APPLIED/delivered half
    stays owned by the delivery-time splice, and the two never compete for one
    certification: ``selection.relations`` is either empty (silent → here) or non-empty
    (shaped → splice), never both. A zero-byte NO_EFFECT can never exact-join a delivery
    and is skipped by the terminal's candidate-identity correctness grader, so it can
    never manufacture a False mediation verdict — it is honest presence, not a claim.

    Pure instrumentation: emits through :func:`_record_control` (a no-op when the seam
    wired no recorder), touches no delivered bytes, and is armed only when the
    GT_SCOPE_NATIVE FORM arm is active (byte-identical when the flag is off)."""
