"""The Gate Kernel — a pure, deterministic submit decision.

Plan §1/§3 (DELIVER gate). ``gate_verdict`` decides ALLOW | BLOCK from FACTS only
(an executed covering-test verdict, a hygiene predicate) — no LLM, no network, no
task IDs, no gold labels. The caller (the agent-class seam, B2) renders a BLOCK as
a native pre-commit refusal and lets the loop continue.

Fail law (correct-or-quiet; plan §3):
- An UNAVAILABLE signal (no covering tests, env hard-fail, hygiene not computed) is
  PASS-WITH-RECORD — never a false block.
- A kernel exception is ALLOW + ``gate_crash`` (``safe_gate_verdict`` — never brick a
  run; the Lane-A bulkhead lesson).
- BLOCK only on POSITIVE evidence: a real covering-test failure or a hygiene refusal.
- Never deadlock a run at reward 0: after ``max_bounces`` refusals, fail OPEN and
  record ``gate_overridden``.

# ``safe_gate_verdict`` remain the FROZEN decision head consumed by the mini submit
# seam (gt_mini_patch :8250-8380). This certificate wraps that head with a per-field,
# honest account of WHY a run may terminate — every SDLC signal as a
# PASS|FAIL|UNKNOWN|NOT_APPLICABLE fact with provenance + freshness. The certificate
# NEVER opens a second decision path: ``decision`` is a PURE function of the head.
#
# CONTROL LAWS (frozen upstream; mirrored honestly here):
#   - BLOCK only on a measured, attributable, FRESH covering FAIL / hygiene block.
#     The head already enforces this — the certificate does NOT re-decide.
#   - UNKNOWN is VISIBLE (listed in ``unknowns``) and FAILS OPEN (never a block input).
#   - Unavailable never blocks.
#   - FRESHNESS applies to EVIDENCE-bearing fields (covering/selected_test, scope,
#     plan results): evidence whose stamped revision != the submit-time revision is
#     STALE. A stale PASS is demoted to UNKNOWN (a stale green is not a green). A stale
#     FAIL is re-run territory — a PURE function cannot re-run, so it too is demoted to
#     UNKNOWN and the stale covering is DROPPED from the head (the seam already re-runs
#     cached FAILs and passes a fresh result / its own head; this is the pure-function
#     mirror). HYGIENE is NOT freshness-dropped: the seam recomputes `git diff
#     --numstat` at submit time, so hygiene is fresh by construction, not by stamp.
#     Staleness that cannot be PROVEN (either revision unknown, empty, or whitespace)
#     is treated as fresh — correct-or-quiet never fabricates a stale.
#   - T2 REGRESSION LAW (measured 4/4, 2026-07-08): ``obligation_coverage`` is ADVISORY
#     ONLY. It may NEVER contribute to a block or to an allow-encouragement threshold.

    PURE + deterministic: no I/O, no clock, no globals. Every argument is evidence a
    caller already computed with the frozen engines — this function CONSUMES shapes, it
    never re-runs an engine. Field sources:
      - ``syntax``       <- edit_check.check_edit_syntax result.
      - ``covering``     <- covering_runner.run_covering_tests result (selected_test).
      - ``plan_results`` <- W3 VerificationPlan results ``{"build": ..., "type": ...}``
                           when present; absent -> build/type NOT_APPLICABLE.
      - ``scope_compliance`` <- the governor's computed value (bool/dict/str).
      - ``hygiene``      <- patch_auditor.diff_hygiene record (feeds the head).
      - ``submit_block`` <- positive submit-boundary failure (feeds the same head).
      - ``reproduction`` <- an optional reproduction runner result; absent -> N/A.
      - ``obligations``  <- ADVISORY coverage only (T2 law).

    ``decision`` is a pure function of the head: ``head`` when the seam supplies its own
    verdict (authoritative), else ``safe_gate_verdict`` over the SAME covering/hygiene/
    bounce args the seam passes. A STALE covering (revision != ``submit_revision``) is
    dropped from the head computation so a submit is NEVER blocked on stale evidence —
    the seam re-runs cached FAILs upstream; this mirrors that for the pure path.
