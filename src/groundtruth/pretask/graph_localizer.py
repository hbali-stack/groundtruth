"""Symbol-anchored multi-hop graph-witness localizer (L1 core).

THE DIAGNOSED FAILURE this module exists to close (real beets-5495 run,
gt_run_summary): the L1 ranker selected candidate files by LEXICAL keyword
overlap -> l1_candidate_files=['beets/util/pipeline.py','beets/library.py']
with the gold file beets/importer.py NOT a candidate, those candidates had 0
call/import/test edges, l1_confidence_score=0.0, yet a "Highest-confidence
candidate" line still rendered. The lexical path never TRAVERSED graph.db, so it
missed importer.py even though importer.py::set_fields has a CALLS edge to
dbcore/db.py::set_parse — the exact symbol pair the issue names.

This module fixes that by anchoring on issue SYMBOLS (not file blobs) and
walking graph.db edges from those symbol nodes, recording a structural WITNESS
for every candidate file it surfaces.

RESEARCH BASIS (deterministic parts only — no embeddings / no GNN / no LLM):
  * KGCompass 2025: 89.7% of localizable bugs carry NO explicit file/line hint
    and are recoverable ONLY via multi-hop traversal over a code graph from
    issue-anchored entities. => seed on symbols, BFS the graph.
  * SWERank 2025 (retrieve -> rerank): down-rank "hard negatives" — files that
    are lexically similar to the issue but structurally UNWITNESSED (our
    pipeline.py / library.py). => a witnessed candidate MUST outrank a
    witness-less lexical-only one.
  * RepoGraph (ICLR 2025): a k=1 ego-graph is the strongest single hop; FILTER
    stdlib / third-party edges so the walk stays repo-internal. => default 1-hop,
    optional 2nd hop; stdlib-shadow guard on edges.
  * BLUiR (ASE 2013): structured field-level lexical anchoring on
    function/class/identifier names beats flat-blob BM25. => the lexical
    component of the rerank scores issue-term ∩ symbol/path identifiers, not a
    document blob.
  * CoSIL 2025: a pruner that drops unrelated directions + top-K narrowing keeps
    precision high. => top-K cap on witnessed candidates.

We deliberately do NOT adopt SWERank's neural reranker / GREPO's GNN — those
violate GroundTruth's LLM-free, deterministic-only core contract.

Everything here is pure sqlite + regex over graph.db. No model, no network.

# Composite rerank weights (the Hybrid pillar: >=3 independent signals).
#
# A witnessed candidate's score is:
#   score = W_WITNESS * witness_strength      # structural (graph)  -- PRIMARY
#         + W_LEX     * structured_lexical    # field-level lexical (BLUiR)
#         + W_DEGREE  * degree_prior          # caller-frequency / centrality
#
# Rationale for the ordering W_WITNESS > W_LEX > W_DEGREE:
#   * W_WITNESS dominates because the whole point (SWERank hard-negative
#     principle + KGCompass) is that a structural edge from an issue-named symbol
#     is stronger evidence of the edit target than keyword overlap, which is
#     exactly what mislocalized beets-5495 (pipeline.py won on lexical alone).
#   * W_LEX is a real but secondary signal (BLUiR): a file whose own
#     symbol/path identifiers intersect the issue terms is more likely relevant,
#     but only as a tie-breaker among witnessed files, never enough to beat a
#     verified-edge witness on its own.
#   * W_DEGREE is the weakest (RepoGraph hub caution): high in-degree is a hub
#     prior, useful only to break ties, and it is hub-penalized so a pure hub
#     never wins on degree alone.
# These are NOT calibrated magic constants in the benchmark sense — they encode
# the cited research ordering. The CONFIDENCE GATE downstream is data-derived
# (per-task median gap), so the absolute scale of these weights is not load-
# bearing; only their ORDER is.

# Degree prior: weak centrality tie-breaker, hub-capped by tanh. NOTE: a hub-PENALTY
# variant (degree as `- W_HUB*deg_norm`) was tested on the v15.2 holdout and REVERTED
# — it regressed python hit@1 (8->6) while only helping rust (net wash), because some
# real edit targets are themselves high-degree (crossplane gold deg 250 > the hub
# beating it at 201). The data FALSIFIED the RepoGraph hub-penalty hypothesis for this
# localization metric, so the original small positive prior is kept (measure-first).
W_DEGREE = 0.10
# Generated / codegen files are NEVER hand-edited fix targets -> heavy demote (kept as
# a last-resort, not hard-dropped). Cross-ecosystem markers, not benchmark-shaped. This
# SURVIVED measurement: run_function.pb.go (a protobuf) no longer out-ranks the gold.
# Subject bonus: a file that DEFINES the issue's SUBJECT symbol (the broken
# function, named earliest in the issue) is the likely EDIT TARGET. This must
# dominate the raw centrality (degree) prior — otherwise a high-in-degree CALLEE
# (db.py::set_parse) out-ranks the CALLER the issue is actually about
# (importer.py::set_fields), which is the RepoGraph/SWERank hub-bias failure.
# Set above W_DEGREE so the subject always beats a pure centrality tie, but below
# W_LEX/W_WITNESS so it never overturns a stronger structural/lexical signal.

# grep finds files with keywords, the graph finds files at the CENTER of
# the keyword-relevant code cluster. Weight above W_DEGREE (it's a stronger
# structural signal) but below W_WITNESS (direct edge > neighborhood count).
# NOTE (doc correction): Personalized PageRank is NOT implemented — there is no
# W_PPR constant and no PPR computation in this module. Multi-hop structural
# proximity is captured instead by the path-decay reach signal (`_path_decay_scores`,
# Dijkstra over verified edges) fused via RRF (GT_LOC_FUSION_V2). This paragraph is
# retained only to record that PPR was considered and deliberately NOT built (reach
# already over-promotes hubs; the architecture subordinates structural reach on
# purpose — adding diffused PPR mass would worsen the hub-bias, not help).

# Witness strength by edge provenance (correct-or-quiet).
# EDGE witnesses (CALLS/IMPORTS): structural evidence — the file is connected
# to an issue symbol via a real code dependency. This is the GRAPH's value-add.
# DEFINES witnesses: lexical evidence — the file merely defines a symbol whose
# name appears in the issue. This is what grep/BM25 already gives you; it
# carries no structural depth. Must score BELOW edge witnesses so the graph
# actually adds ranking value over grep (LIPI diagnosis: when both scored 1.0,
# the localizer degenerated to expensive BM25 — 23% hit@1).

# a verified 1-hop CALLS edge (1.0*conf*0.5=0.50) on the raw scalar that feeds
# Candidate.confidence (the [VERIFIED] render gate) and the W_WITNESS score term.
# That is a lexical signal out-ranking a structural one — the exact inversion this
# module exists to kill. The sort already tiers correctly (_witness_tier), but the
# SCALAR did not. Fix: the DEFINES scalar is CAPPED strictly below the minimum
# possible verified-EDGE strength. The deepest BFS hop is bounded by
# _dynamic_max_hop (ceiling 3) and localize(max_hop=3), so a verified edge's
# weakest decay factor is 1/(1+_MAX_DECAY_HOP). _WITNESS_DEFINES_CEIL sits just

    """Semantic similarity between the issue and each candidate file's CODE CONTENT.

    CHANGE 1 — symbol-level granularity. Each non-test SYMBOL in a candidate file is
    embedded as its own short ``"{name} {signature}\\n{behavioral props}"`` passage
    (~80-token cap) and the file scores by ColBERT MaxSim over its symbols —
    ``alpha*max_i(cos_i) + (1-alpha)*mean(top_k cos_i)`` — so a file's gold function
    is not averaged into its 60 siblings (which collapsed sibling cosines to a flat
    0.80-0.84 band). Demand-scoped to the candidate ``files`` set only. Return CONTRACT
    is byte-identical: ``dict[file_path -> float]``; empty dict when no embedder.

    R1 leaf-naming bridge (correct-or-quiet, additive): the per-SYMBOL MaxSim cosines
    computed here for the FILE score were previously discarded. When ``symbol_scores_out``
    is supplied, it is populated in place with ``{file_norm: [(symbol_name, cosine), ...]}``
    so the symbol-naming stage (``v1r_brief._localization_header``) can rank WITHIN-FILE
    leaves by the same semantic signal that reached the gold file — instead of raw
    in-degree (which names the hub on behavior-described issues). The returned float
    dict is unchanged; ``symbol_scores_out`` defaults to ``None`` so every existing
    caller is byte-identical, and it stays empty whenever the embedder is off.

    ENCODE DISCIPLINE (fix 2026-06-09, gt_gt §11.2 "cache by node-content hash"):
    ``files`` iteration order is the PRIORITY order (the call site passes the
    pre-semantic candidate ranking). Vectors are content-addressed in the shared
    bounded-LRU ``embed._PASSAGE_VEC_CACHE`` (model+dim+version-keyed
    ``passage_hash``) so the SAME passage — scored again this task by the other
    semantic half, or on a later call — is never re-encoded. Fresh encodes are
    hard-capped by ``GT_SEM_PASSAGE_BUDGET``; past the budget, the lowest-priority
    files simply stay unscored (absent from the result, never a fake 0.0) and ONE
    ``[GT_SEM] passage budget hit (X/Y encoded)`` line goes to stderr — bounded
    beats killed."""

    # witness VOLUME is net-harmful vs grep — hub files with 100s of generic witnesses
    # buried the specific gold, and neither RRF nor degree-normalization fixed it. So
    # grep order is the SPINE; the graph PROMOTES a file above grep order ONLY when it
    # carries a verified, non-DEFINES (edge) witness anchored on an ISSUE symbol —
    # specific structural evidence, never popularity. Hubs have volume but no
    # issue-anchored witness, so they do not promote and grep order stands: GT MATCHES
    # grep where it has no specific signal, and only BEATS grep where the graph sees a
    # real issue-anchored edge grep cannot. SWERank retrieve->rerank applied
    # conservatively (promote-only). struct_rank is a tiebreaker, never a demoter.
    # SEMANTIC RANKER — the issue->code bridge grep and graph cannot cross. Dense
    # cosine between the issue and each candidate file's code content (names +
    # docstrings + call_order/guards from the graph). This is the signal that finally
    # localizes the cases where the gold shares NO surface tokens with the issue
    # (weasyprint overflow->block_box_layout; sqllineage MetaDataProvider->create_insert).
