    """Deterministic-provenance caller AND callee witnesses for ``file_path``.

    This is the STRUCTURED twin of ``_caller_contract_for_file``: it surfaces the
    RESOLVED call-edge FACTS already in graph.db so a candidate carries a concrete
    call-edge witness at iter-0 (fixes the audited ``l1_candidates_with_call_edge_count
    = 0`` / ``l1_primary_witness_file = 'N/A — no confirming edge'`` — the resolution
    was on disk but never surfaced as a confirming edge in the L1 brief).

    A witness is emitted ONLY when its edge ``resolution_method`` is in
    ``DETERMINISTIC_RESOLUTION_METHODS`` (the unified categorical fact-set, shared
    with curation_map / post_edit). ``name_match`` is NEVER a witness here — even a
    single-candidate name_match scores 0.9 and is still a name GUESS. The same
    ``_is_stdlib_shadow`` guard the brief's caller line applies is applied here, so a
    DETERMINISTIC-tagged edge that is really a stdlib attribute call name-matched to a
    same-named project symbol (``os.walk`` -> project ``walk``) is dropped despite its
    recorded provenance (wire.md RUN VERDICT: the provenance gate alone trusts that
    false fact; the stdlib guard is the secondary defense).

    Returns a list of dicts ``{relation: 'CALLS', direction: 'caller'|'callee',
    file_path, line, symbol, target, code}`` — caller witnesses first (a caller is
    the stronger localization confirmation: it proves the candidate's symbol is a
    REAL, USED target). Correct-or-quiet: empty list on any error / no DB / no
    deterministic edge. Pure read; no ranking effect (BRIEFING.md §3 row 4 / §4 —
    surface facts that already rank, never change reach/weights).

        across the pipeline.
      * PROVENANCE beats string shape for short names. The `len<5 and no _` skip is a SHAPE
        heuristic against prose collisions; a short name the reporter put in the TITLE or in
