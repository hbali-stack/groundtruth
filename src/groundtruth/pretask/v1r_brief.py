      the LIMIT — the case the anchor-first sort was built for.
    * ``nl_terms`` — the raw NL word bag. When ``nl_hoist`` is False (the caller
      separated provenance, so these are KNOWN to be prose-only) a name that
      coincidentally matches a word (``start``, ``template``, ``check``) must NOT
      out-rank a structurally-central function — it is only a TIEBREAK *under*
      ``ref_count DESC``. When ``nl_hoist`` is True (LEGACY callers that pass no
      ``code_symbols`` channel, so provenance is unknown) NL terms keep the old
      absolute hoist — back-compat for direct callers and the ``set_fields``
      single-channel guarantee.

    Returns ``(order_by_sql, params)``. The caller binds ``file_path`` FIRST,
    then these params, then any trailing LIMIT param.

    This is the STRUCTURED twin of ``_caller_contract_for_file``: it surfaces the

    call-edge witness at iter-0 (fixes the audited ``l1_candidates_with_call_edge_count
    = 0`` / ``l1_primary_witness_file = 'N/A — no confirming edge'`` — the resolution
    was on disk but never surfaced as a confirming edge in the L1 brief).

    A witness is emitted ONLY when its edge ``resolution_method`` is in
    ``DETERMINISTIC_RESOLUTION_METHODS`` (the unified categorical fact-set, shared
    with curation_map / post_edit). ``name_match`` is NEVER a witness here — even a
    single-candidate name_match scores 0.9 and is still a name GUESS. The same
    ``_is_stdlib_shadow`` guard the brief's caller line applies is applied here, so a

    same-named project symbol (``os.walk`` -> project ``walk``) is dropped despite its

    false fact; the stdlib guard is the secondary defense).

    the stronger localization confirmation: it proves the candidate's symbol is a

    ``GT_BRIEF_MINIMAL`` is an UNMAPPED Profile-2 member (no importable backing module), so
    the ``rl_profile`` preflight passes WITHOUT proving the baked brief was minimalized — at
    the SM-8 rebake the GT-on arm could ship the FULL step-0 brief while claiming minimal,
    which silently invalidates the paired GT-on vs GT-off comparison. This function is that
    missing certificate: SM-8 generates the baked brief with ``GT_BRIEF_MINIMAL=1`` and calls
    ``brief_minimal_certificate(brief.brief_text)`` to REFUSE shipping an arm whose brief still
    carries a retired step-0 narration surface.

    PURE read of ``brief_text`` — no I/O, no env, no mutation. NOTHING in the live brief
    pipeline calls it (:func:`generate_v1r_brief` never references it), so adding it is
    byte-identical to the running product — it is an SM-8 rebake / SM-7 gate check only.

    Returns ``{minimal, retired_present, obligations_present, orientation_present}``:

# trim breadth (candidate entries) then detail (per-body-line cap) but can bottom
# out — a single entry + the body cap at its floor + fixed header/block overhead —
# STILL over budget (measured: caps 100/20/1 produced 244/242/242 tokens; the rail
# was never enforced). This enforcer guarantees ``_count_tokens(result) <= budget``
# by dropping whole rendered brief blocks LOWEST-priority first (recording each
# suppression), then — only if the protected core still exceeds the cap —
# truncating the residue. The localizer / ``.files`` are untouched: this trims the
# rendered DOSE, never which files the agent is told to consider (BRIEFING.md §3).

# Keep-priority (highest survives): active obligation > violated contract >
# causal edge (Witness/Callers) > repo law (Context/Spec) > companion surface

# "Expected behavior", "EDIT-TARGET CONTRACTS", the file-list headers, and each
# file's Witness/Contract are PROTECTED by the passes; only the final hard

    A step-0 brief is by definition not demand-triggered, so the default path emits

    so the obligations ride the model's native requirements-list channel in-distribution. Leak-safe:
    every row already passed ``_obligation_is_leaky`` upstream; the native form only swaps the frame
    + bullet (no test identity can enter here).

    SS-5 GT_SS_ACK_FORM (layered ON TOP of GT_BRIEF_NATIVE): additionally apply the requirement-
    extractor discipline — keep only IMPERATIVE requirement items (drop repro fragments / pleas via
    ``_obligation_is_imperative``) and strip the ``[<kind>]`` classifier. GT_BRIEF_NATIVE-alone (ACK
    OFF) is byte-identical to today's plain-checklist arm. Correct-or-quiet: when no imperative
    requirement survives, the block is dropped entirely (``[]``) rather than shipping an empty
    header."""

    """Render the ``<gt-obligations>`` behavioral-spec block, or ``[]`` when quiet.

    ``cap`` is the body-line clip closure from ``render_brief``. Returns a list of
    rendered lines (block tags included) or an empty list (correct-or-quiet).

    ``require_anchor`` (default True — byte-identical for every existing caller)
    gates the block on FOCUS/anchor overlap so the spec is never coupled to a
    WRONG located file. On the B-2 no-match path (``generate_v1r_brief`` has NO
    ranked existing file) there IS no located file to be wrong about, so the
    caller passes ``require_anchor=False``: the leak screen (``_obligation_is_leaky``)
    still runs, but the relevance gate is bypassed so the issue's own behavioral
    obligations still reach the agent at step 0.

    ``anchor_symbols`` are the issue's own curated code identifiers
    (``IssueAnchors.symbols`` ∪ ``code_symbols`` ∪ ``unresolved_code_symbols`` —
    BugLocator ICSE 2012 issue-subject tokens). They are unioned with the focus
    function tokens to form the relevance anchor. This is the SUBJECT of the issue
    (``range`` / ``coredump`` / ``bytes``), which an obligation legitimately
    describes even when that symbol is (a) a net-new feature not yet present in any
    indexed function (feature-add tasks — e.g. wasmi ``coredump``), or (b) a
    low-ref-count function truncated out of the top-N focus list (e.g. pest
    ``range`` at rank #13, beyond MAX_FUNCTIONS_PER_FILE). Focus tokens alone miss
    both cases → the whole obligation block was silently dropped on those tasks.

    NAMED as #1 (the HIGH edit target, or the first shown candidate) — empty when no
    header fires. The caller (``generate_v1r_brief``) uses it to make the SAME file
    that ``<gt-localization>`` names #1 the ``entries[0]`` that the L1-SCOPE block,
    ``render_brief`` file list, graph-map, and EDIT-TARGET CONTRACTS all key off — so
    the two independently-ordered pipes can no longer name different #1 files (the L1
    cross-wire, confirmed live cfn-lint-3749). Single ordering source, consumed verbatim.

    Granularity scales with RESEARCH-BACKED structural confidence — a verified graph
    edge anchored on an ISSUE-named entity (KGCompass: multi-hop from issue entities),
    NOT raw lexical score (which is high for lexical-subsystem traps like an `overflow`
    validator). Never prescribes one edit imperatively; always leaves the pick to the
    agent (SWE-agent: the agent self-localizes; we augment, not command).

    issue (gt_gt §4 exact-name seeder). A symbol the issue literally names is the strongest
    localization signal that exists — its DEFINING file MUST be a guaranteed candidate, never
    composite-scored-and-cut.
    Language/repo-agnostic (graph name match), test-blind (is_test=0). LIPI: arviz issue names
    plot_hdi 4x + links hdiplot.py, yet run_v74 never anchored it so the gold was absent from
    ranked_full. SPECIFICITY (proven needed by held-out loguru-1297): an issue-named symbol is a
    localization signal ONLY if it is SPECIFIC — generic names (`__init__`, `print`) appear in the
    issue AND in many files, flooding the guarantee and burying the real gold. So: skip dunders,
    skip short generic names, and skip any name that resolves to MORE than a few files.

    UPDATED (fix 2026-06-10 — §4 candidate-union recall defect). Two generalized gaps closed:
      * CLASS-like definitions count. The label filter was Function/Method only, so an issue
        whose title names the defective CLASS verbatim (defined in <= _MAX_FILES_PER_NAME
        files — a one-line grep for any agent) never earned the guarantee and the gold could
        be absent from every rendered slot. Class/Interface is the same class-like set
        graph_localizer._seed_node_rows already seeds on — ONE definition of "definition"
        across the pipeline.
      * PROVENANCE beats string shape for short names. The `len<5 and no _` skip is a SHAPE
        heuristic against prose collisions; a short name the reporter put in the TITLE or in
        BACKTICKS (IssueAnchors.title_symbols / code_symbols — BugLocator ICSE 2012 summary
        weighting; arXiv:2512.07022 code-mention provenance) is reporter-confirmed, not a
        collision — it bypasses the shape skip ONLY (still subject to the dunder / generic /
        ambiguity gates: confidence-gated, never a free pass).

    Fuses per-class (lexical/semantic/structural/path/historical) reciprocal-rank
    scores so a file backed by MANY independent evidence classes ranks above a
    single-signal file, tie-broken by class count, raw strength, then the
    localizer's own rank and canonical path (incoming order only breaks duplicate-
    path ties).

    P0 #2 fix (2026-07-01) — two defects in the pre-extraction inline version:
      (1) The ``strength > 0`` filter SILENTLY DROPPED records whose evidence
          lives outside the 8-key strength sum — synthesized exact-issue-named
          recall-miss gold (no ``components``), graph-neighbor (``{"path":0.0}``),
          and cochange/test_coimport bridges — undoing the recall/neighborhood
          machinery upstream. They are now KEPT (``_keep_recall_or_bridge``); with
          strength 0 they RRF-sort to the BOTTOM, so recall is preserved without
          ever floating them above real-evidence gold.
      (2) The verified-witness flag lived ONLY in the side-dict
          ``witness_verified_by_file`` and was never written onto the record, so
          ``_issue_evidence_strength`` / ``_positive_evidence_classes`` scored
          verified gold as un-witnessed and multi-signal HUBS out-sorted it. The
          flag (and the localizer rank) are now STAMPED onto each record first.

    Correct-or-quiet: a genuinely hollow set (no real evidence AND no
    recall/neighbor/bridge anchor) still returns ``[]`` so the empty-proof gate
    can halt instead of delivering noise.
