    The cosine of EVERY indexed file is computed (one matmul: ``file_embs @
    issue_emb``); ``k_sem_top`` only controls how many of those scores are
    RETURNED. Two distinct uses are deliberately decoupled by the caller:

      * ``score_all=False`` (default): return the top-``k_sem_top`` slice — the
        bounded SEED set that becomes candidate-set membership (no flooding).
      * ``score_all=True``: return the FULL score map (every file with a finite,
        strictly-positive cosine). This is the COMPONENT-score source: it lets a
        candidate already in the set (via graph / BM25 / path) carry its REAL
        cosine in ``components['sem']`` instead of a spurious 0. Without it the
        ``sem`` component is structurally zero on every candidate outside the
        top-``k_sem_top``, which makes a present-but-unconsumed embedder
        indistinguishable from a genuinely-zero one. Correct-or-quiet: a file
        whose cosine is <= 0 or non-finite is omitted (never injected as fact),
        so a truly-zero embedder yields an empty map exactly as before.

    The full map is keyed identically to the bounded slice, so a candidate's
    component lookup (`sem_all.get(fp, 0.0)`) returns its real cosine whether or
    not it made the seed cut. The DESIGN INTENT (this function's original
    docstring: "full {file: score} map for Stage B") is restored without
    widening the candidate set.

    CHANGE 1: each file now scores by ColBERT MaxSim over its per-symbol vectors —
    ``alpha*max_i(cos_i) + (1-alpha)*mean(top_k cos_i)`` (``aggregate_symbol_cosines``)
    — so the gold function is not averaged into 60 siblings. The return CONTRACT is
