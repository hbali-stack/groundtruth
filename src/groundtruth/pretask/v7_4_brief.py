"""v7.4 brief — semantic-anchored multi-hop localization reranker.

Two stages:
  Stage A — candidate generation: semantic_top_K ∪ graph_expand(trusted_anchors)
  Stage B — reranking: hybrid score (sem + lex + reach + anchor_prox - hub_pen)

Score components (independent weights, calibrated on 20-bug split):
  sem  — dense cosine similarity (sentence-transformer)
  lex  — normalized BM25 score (lexical overlap with issue text)
  reach — graph BFS reachability from trusted anchors (hub-scaled)
  anchor_prox — proximity to trusted anchors in call graph
  hub_pen — hub penalty: tanh(in_degree / HUB_SCALE)

Ablation variants (controlled by 'ablation' parameter):
  A  — dense only (W_SEM; W_LEX=W_REACH=W_PROX=W_HUB=W_COMMIT=0)
  B0 — graph only, symbol-match anchors only (W_SEM=W_LEX=0)
  B1 — graph rerank from semantic anchors (W_SEM=W_LEX=0)
  C  — hybrid core (all terms; W_COMMIT=0)
  D  — hybrid + commit prior (C + W_COMMIT > 0)

Feature-flag: GT_BRIEF_VERSION=v7_4 activates this scorer.

    Research:
      LocAgent ACL 2025 — graph reach matters MORE at function-level (+5.5pp)
        than file-level (+2pp); multi-hop reasoning improves deeper localization.
      arxiv 2412.03905 — deepest stack frame = 98.3% bug-location correlation.
      SweRank ICLR 2025 — code entity resolution for localization.
      Agentless ICLR 2025 — hierarchical narrowing (file → function → line).

    Dimension 1: SIGNAL PRESENCE (what signals exist in this issue)
      TRACEBACK → W_FRAME dominates (runtime evidence)
      CODE_REF → W_CODE_DEF dominates (reporter named the entity)
      NEITHER → base weights unchanged

    Dimension 2: SCOPE (single-file vs multi-file, from graph structure)
      If issue anchors resolve to 1 file → function-level: boost W_REACH + W_PROX
        (graph signals matter more when you need to find the right FUNCTION)
      If anchors spread across 3+ files → file-level: boost W_LEX + W_PATH
        (BM25 matters more when you need to find the right FILE)
      Ambiguous → no change

    Dimension 3: GRAPH CONFIDENCE (how trustworthy are the edges)
      If graph has >70% deterministic edges → boost W_REACH (trust the graph)
      If graph has <30% deterministic → reduce W_REACH (graph is noisy)
      Middle → no change

    All dimensions compose additively. Each is a gate that either fires or
    falls back. Worst case = no gate fires = base weights unchanged.

    Dimension 0: QUERY LEXICALITY (FUSION REDESIGN — runs FIRST so later dims
      compose over it via max/min). Classifies the issue (identifier_heavy /
      nl_gap / mixed) from issue_text + IssueAnchors, then leads the fusion toward
      the signal that query type favors WITHOUT throttling the other:

          to the floor (BEIR NeurIPS 2021 + Sciavolino EMNLP 2021: exact-identifier
          queries favor lexical) — dense floored, never zeroed.
        nl_gap -> dense LEADS (W_SEM floored up to 0.45); lexical left at base.

    The dense signal that reaches the linear fusion can arrive FLAT: every candidate
    carries (near-)identical cosine, or only 1–2 candidates carry any cosine at all
    (the §11.2 granularity/coverage symptom AT the fusion input). A flat dense vector
    cannot ORDER the candidates — but with W_SEM at its dense-led default it still
    arbitrarily boosts whichever 1–2 files happen to carry coverage, washing out the
    structural/anchor ordering (gold defined-by-anchor files sink).

    Detection (query-performance prediction, deterministic): the MAD of the sem
    component over the candidate set, normalized by the per-task max (scale-free —
    Shtok et al. TOIS 2012 NQC; Cummins et al. SIGIR 2011 score-dispersion). MAD is
    0 both for the all-equal case and the 1-of-N-covered case — exactly the two flat

      * W_SEM is LED DOWN to the dense floor (floored, NEVER zeroed — §11.6
        forbid_no_sem_config invariant; the embedder stays a co-signal).

        defines-file), W_FRAME (runtime-named file), W_LEX/W_PATH (exact lexical
        surface), W_PROX (anchor proximity). W_REACH is deliberately NOT raised —
        reach over-promotes hubs and the architecture subordinates it (BRIEFING §3,

    GATE in the Dimension-1 style, not continuous tuning):

      identifier_heavy — the issue is dominated by EXACT lexical surface forms a
        BM25/FTS index matches verbatim: a tool error/rule code (``E1010``),
        backtick-wrapped code symbols, and/or a path that RESOLVES to an indexed

        Dense Retrievers") — exact-identifier / entity queries favor sparse lexical
        retrieval over dense. Lexical LEADS here; dense is floored, not throttled.

      nl_gap — natural-language prose describing a behavior with little or no exact
        identifier surface (a "lexical gap" query). Dense LEADS here: the semantic
        embedder bridges the vocabulary mismatch BM25 cannot. Research: the dense-
        retrieval motivation in BEIR / Karpukhin et al. (DPR, EMNLP 2020).

      mixed — ambiguous / both present in balance -> NO change (byte-identical to
        the pre-change ranker; the no-regression bucket).

    Path resolution: a raw path COUNTS as an identifier signal ONLY if it resolves
    against the indexed graph (reuse ``_resolve_against_graph_files``) — so one
    stray, unindexed path in prose does not misclassify a natural-language issue.
