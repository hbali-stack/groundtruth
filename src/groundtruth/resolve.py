    returns the FIRST substring occurrence — ``find("get")`` on
    ``config.get_key(x) or store.get(k)`` points INSIDE ``get_key`` (col of the

    (``get``/``join``/``append``/``items``...) whose name is a common substring of
    LONGER same-prefixed names, that mis-aim is the dominant failure.

    This finds ``\\btarget_name\\s*\\(`` (a word-bounded occurrence immediately

    When several call-shaped occurrences exist and ``expected_col`` is provided
    (the call-site column from graph.db, if stored), the occurrence whose start is
    NEAREST ``expected_col`` is preferred; otherwise the first is returned.

    Returns ``(-1, False)`` when there is no call-shaped occurrence — the caller

    This is the *denominator* of the resolution-fraction reported on the

    ``_get_ambiguous_edges`` (which returns *all* sub-threshold CALLS edges and
    is capped by ``--max-edges``): the metric needs the true count of the
    population the LSP precision pass is meant to convert.

    The residual population is encoded structurally and LANGUAGE-AGNOSTICALLY as
    every ``name_match`` CALLS edge to an indexed target — the call whose target was
    matched by NAME across files/classes because the receiver/import type was never
    resolved, so the edge is a guess, not a fact. This deliberately does NOT filter
    on ``tgt.label = 'Method'``: that filter was a Python-only artifact (only the
    Python spec labels ``obj.m()`` targets ``Method``; the Go/JS/TS/Rust specs label
    them ``Function``), so on a non-Python graph it counted ~0 residual and stamped a
    FALSE ``no_op_valid`` pass while hundreds of unresolved name_match edges remained
    (aiomonitor: ~475 residual read as 0). Per CLAUDE.md (conan-17123 trace) ~98% of
    name_match edges are unresolved method/cross-file calls regardless of label —
    this is the population graph.db cannot trust until LSP/propagation resolves the
    target. The count is scoped to ``source_files`` (the issue
    subgraph) when given, else the whole graph — this is what makes a capped or
    un-scoped pass *detectable*: ``resolved/residual`` drops when only a slice of a
    large residual was touched.

    ``cap`` makes the denominator CAP-CONSISTENT with the attempt budget
    (``--max-edges``). The resolve pass can only attempt at most ``cap`` edges, so
    measuring ``resolved`` against a residual LARGER than ``cap`` yields a ceiling of
    ``cap/residual`` that can fall below the gate floor even at 100% LSP success —
    a mathematically unpassable gate on any large un-scoped repo (the checkov class).
    Capping the residual at the attempt budget makes the fraction "of what we could
    attempt, how many resolved," so the floor is real work, not a coin-flip against
    the cap. Language-agnostic: it is a property of the attempt budget vs population,
    not of any repo/language. When demand-scoping makes the residual naturally small
    (< cap), the cap is a no-op and the fraction is the true in-scope resolution rate.

    unit tests run the IDENTICAL match + delete-guard logic. Returns the outcome
    label ("verified" / "corrected" / "deleted" / "skipped") it recorded.

    item #29 — match PRIMARILY by ``(file_path, line-window)``. The LSP's LOCATION
    is the authority, not the pre-resolution callee NAME. The old query hard-filtered
    ``name = target_name``, so a CORRECTED call to a differently-named symbol (alias,
    re-export, ``super().__init__`` → the parent class name) never matched the real
    node and fell to the destructive DELETE arm — the exact ambiguous-method case
    this pass exists to FIX. ``name`` is now only a TIEBREAKER inside the window
    (``ORDER BY (name = ?) DESC``), never a gate. The window itself
    (``start_line <= target_line <= end_line``, or NULL ``end_line``) is unchanged.
    Exact ``file_path`` match — NOT ``LIKE '%basename'`` which collides on common
    basenames (mod.rs, index.ts, utils.py, __init__.py) and can pick the WRONG node.

    item #28 — a missing node is NOT automatically a false positive. DELETE is the
    highest-harm action in this file (a read-pass that destroys edges), so it fires
    ONLY when we can PROVE the edge is spurious: the LSP definition lands in a file
    the indexer DID ingest, yet no node there spans the call site. Two cases must
    NEVER delete:
      (1) EXTERNAL/stdlib target — ``target_rel`` is empty, escaped with ``..``, or
          absolute (the LSP correctly resolved OUTSIDE the repo — the common
          join/get/append/loads case). That is a real resolution; leave the edge
          intact (correct-or-quiet). Deleting it would erase a true call edge.
      (2) FILE NOT INDEXED — ``target_rel`` has zero nodes in graph.db (generated/
          vendored/excluded). No ground truth there, so a line-window miss (incl.
          NULL ``end_line`` / tree-sitter↔LSP line drift on decorators/comments)
          must NOT trigger a destructive delete.
    Only when the file IS indexed AND still no window match → genuine FP → delete.
