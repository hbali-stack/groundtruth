# Substrate Re-proof LIPI - 2026-06-12

Scope: Go/Rust substrate proof blockers on the mini-swe integration path.

This note records the product-owned fixes after the proof-sweep parity repair
(`42e27fce`). The key change in state is that the failures are now real and
stage-localized, not hidden by workflow blindness.

## Go

Symptom:
- `GO_WORKSPACE_METADATA_FAIL` on real tasks before the LSP pass.
- ABS tasks fail with `go.mod requires go >= 1.24 (running go 1.22.5; GOTOOLCHAIN=local)`.
- `arcane-drift-detection-baselines` fails with `-mod may only be set to readonly or vendor when in workspace mode, but it is set to "mod"`.

Logic:
- Broken. Product readiness for Go belongs to offline workspace metadata load, not
  "gopls launched" and not "some cache path existed".
- Forcing `GOFLAGS=-mod=mod` globally is the wrong product default because it breaks
  `go.work` repos before readiness can even be measured.

Implementation:
- Broken. `docker/Dockerfile.gt-substrate` baked Go `1.22.5`, below live task minimums,
  and exported `GOFLAGS=-mod=mod`.

Integration:
- Broken. The workflow handoff is now correct, so these Dockerfile choices directly
  reach `gt-run-proof` and fail on the live path.

Plumbing:
- Clean after the parity fix. `proof_failure.json` and `proof_progress.json` now show the
  real substage (`workspace_metadata`) and the real stderr.

Fix:
- Bump baked Go to `1.24.4`.
- Switch substrate default to `GOFLAGS=-mod=readonly`.

## Rust

Symptom:
- Rust proof sweep now fails honestly at dep-manifest time instead of later LSP noise.
- `boa-hierarchical-evaluation-cancellation` has non-empty cargo/rustup copies, but no
  stdlib source tree under the copied rustup path for the active toolchain.

Logic:
- Broken. The product question is not "is rust-src under exactly one layout?" It is:
  "does the copied task toolchain provide the stdlib source tree rust-analyzer needs,
  without mutating the task image or downloading at runtime?"

Implementation:
- Broken. Workflow extraction only looked under rustup's toolchain tree and ignored the
  task sysroot as another legitimate source location.

Integration:
- Broken. `deepswe_full.yml` and `deepswe_proof_sweep.yml` were not fully symmetric on
  Rust runtime env; the sweep also omitted `CARGO_HOME`, `RUSTUP_HOME`, and PATH parity.

Plumbing:
- Partial. `dep_store_manifest.json` correctly shows missing `rust_src`, but it could not
  distinguish "truly absent" from "present in sysroot, not copied into the expected tree".

Fix:
- Backfill rust stdlib source from `rustc --print sysroot` into the extracted rustup tree
  when the active toolchain path is otherwise missing it.
- Preserve truth with explicit `rust_src_host` / `rust_src_source` fields in
  `dep_store_manifest.py`.
- Make proof sweep pass the same Rust env as the paid path.
