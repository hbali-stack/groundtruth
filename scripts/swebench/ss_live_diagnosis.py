    """Adjudicate the run-grain PERF bucket, joining the evidence that IS present.

    The authoritative ``gt_run_metrics.v2`` artifact (``gt_run_metrics.py``) carries
    the per-metric run DISTRIBUTION — the measured/missing/unmeasured/failed/
    not_applicable/right_censored task partitions — but it carries NO ``ss_features``
    and therefore NO run ``ss_readiness``: that readiness object only exists on the
    ``gt_feature_metrics`` run rollup, which this reader is never handed. Reading the
    run readiness from ``run_metrics["ss_features"]`` (as the legacy inline join did)
    is thus structurally guaranteed to miss on real data and collapse every genuinely
    MEASURED run row to ``FAILED:measurement:readiness_role`` — a measurement-defect
    for a metric whose per-task values are fully present.

    When an explicit run readiness IS attached (the rollup path, and the crafted
    fixtures that mirror it), adjudicate it verbatim through ``_perf_status`` so the
    existing bar is unchanged. Otherwise derive the SS-MEASURE run verdict from the
    distribution partition plus this reader's OWN per-task adjudication
    (``task_buckets``, each already gated through ``_perf_status`` at task grain):
    ``aggregate_coverage`` binds MEASURED only when the distribution is complete over
    the whole expected population (no missing/unmeasured/failed tasks) AND every
    contributing task row is a sound, resolved measurement (MEASURED / NOT_APPLICABLE
    / RIGHT_CENSORED). A MEASURED distribution row alone never promotes — the
    per-task SS-MEASURE gates (precision, provenance, structure) are enforced only on
    the task grain, so an unresolved task row fails the run closed with a named gate.
