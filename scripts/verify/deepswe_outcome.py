"""Extract the REAL outcome of a DeepSWE pier run from the jobs/ dir + CLASSIFY it.

Why this exists (learned from the GCP validation run, 2026-06-03):
- The job-level result.json (jobs/<ts>/result.json) is an AGGREGATE — it has no
  n_agent_steps / verifier_result. The per-trial result.json
  (jobs/<ts>/<task>__*/result.json) has them. `find jobs -name result.json | head`
  grabs the wrong one.
- result.json's `step_results` is EMPTY. The per-turn trajectory (commands, gt_hook
  calls, <gt-evidence>) lives in agent/mini-swe-agent.trajectory.json. The pass/fail
  outcome lives in verifier/test-stdout.txt.
- "Brief written to disk" is NOT proof the agent ran. The proof is n_agent_steps>0 +
  exit_status + reward. A run can write the brief and still do 0 useful work (the GHA
  284-empty-reprompt case) or crash before the agent (the cwd / key cases).

This surfaces, in the workflow log: did the AGENT actually run, did it submit, the
reward, the test pass/fail tally, the FAILING tests (the precise correctness gap),
and the GT hook firings from the real trajectory.

FAILURE CLASSIFICATION (audit Stage 5 — added 2026-06-09):
Extraction alone makes a pull/build/harness failure, an agent miss, and a GT-context
miss indistinguishable. For a paid 113-task benchmark every task MUST get a clean,
triageable failure class derived DETERMINISTICALLY from per-task signals — never from
task IDs / gold / per-task exceptions. The four classes (generalized rules, identical
across all 113 tasks):

- INFRA   — image-pull / substrate-pull / harness failure (adapter-wire is GT, not INFRA)
            (GT_SUBSTRATE_DIGEST_MISSING, GT_SUBSTRATE_PULL_FAIL, GT_RUN_PROOF_FAIL,
            GT_ARTIFACT_MISSING, TASK_IMAGE_PULL_FAIL, eval_no_report / harness crash).
            EXCLUDED from the resolved-rate denominator (never an agent/GT failure).
- GT      — GT delivered wrong/no/UNPROVEN context (DEEPSWE_ADAPTER_FAIL,
            gt_prebuilt_active=false, hook != post-LSP graph-hash mismatch, any
            embedder/LSP/graph cert with a FAIL verdict, OR the agent ran without
            resolving while the consumption witness is MISSING — witness-absent =
            unproven consumption = GT's problem, never UNKNOWN-excluded).
- AGENT   — GT context was sound (prebuilt active + valid certs) but the model missed:
            n_agent_steps>0 + reward 0.
- RESOLVED — reward 1.0.

The classifier reads ONLY signals the extractor already parses (reward, exit_status,
the [GT_META] witness fields, the cert verdicts, n_agent_steps). Precedence is
INFRA > GT > RESOLVED > AGENT > UNKNOWN: an infra/wiring break that prevents a clean
comparison wins, then a GT delivery break, then the outcome. INFRA is excluded from the
resolved denominator so it is never miscounted as an agent or GT failure.

PAIRED-DELTA SCAFFOLDING: build_paired_delta() keys a GT-on record against a baseline
record by instance_id for a later Wilcoxon signed-rank on per-task delta. STRUCTURE
ONLY — no baseline is fabricated; when no baseline record is supplied the delta fields
are None.

    Why: the pier/DeepSWE per-trial result.json has NO `instance_id` and NO `info`
    block — the old extractor looked only there and returned null for every task,
    making the paired Wilcoxon (keyed by instance_id) impossible. The identity the
    trial DOES carry: `task_name` ("org/<slug>"), `task_id.path` (".../tasks/<slug>"),
    and the trial dir / `trial_name` ("<slug>__<hash>", slug TRUNCATED by pier — last
    resort only). Priority (first hit wins, deterministic, identical for every task):
      1. explicit `instance_id` (result top-level / info / info.instance) — VERBATIM
         (SWE-bench ids like `astropy__astropy-12907` legitimately contain `__`).
      2. `task_name` -> last path segment (the task slug, the run-set key).
      3. `task_id.path` -> last path segment.
      4. `trial_name` / trial dir name -> trailing `__<attempt-hash>` stripped (the
         hash varies per trial and would break GT-on-vs-baseline pairing).
