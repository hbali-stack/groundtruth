"""TTD (artifact-first, red->green) for the symbol-anchored graph-witness L1.

REFERENCE ARTIFACT — real beets-5495 gt_run_summary:
    l1_candidate_files = ['beets/util/pipeline.py', 'beets/library.py']
    gold beets/importer.py is NOT a candidate
    candidates had 0 call/import/test edges, l1_confidence_score = 0.00
    yet a "Highest-confidence candidate" line still rendered.

ROOT CAUSE: the L1 ranker selected candidates by LEXICAL keyword overlap and
never TRAVERSED graph.db, so it missed importer.py even though
importer.py::set_fields has a CALLS edge to dbcore/db.py::set_parse — the symbol
pair the issue names.

This file builds a synthetic beets-shaped graph.db reproducing that topology:
  * beets/importer.py :: set_fields   CALLS   beets/dbcore/db.py :: set_parse
    (deterministic edge -> verified witness)
  * beets/util/pipeline.py and beets/library.py exist with NO edge to the
    anchored symbols (lexical match to issue keywords only).
Issue text anchors to set_fields / set_parse / "parse" / "field".

RED (pre-fix): rendered brief ranks [pipeline.py, library.py]; importer.py
    absent OR a 0.0-confidence confident directive present.
GREEN (post-fix): the localizer surfaces importer.py as the TOP candidate via
    its set_fields->set_parse witness, ranked above the witness-less files; a
    no-anchor variant SUPPRESSES the confident directive with the grep fallback;
    negative control: a witness-less lexical-only candidate never gets the
    "highest-confidence" line.

No AI anywhere — pure sqlite + regex.
