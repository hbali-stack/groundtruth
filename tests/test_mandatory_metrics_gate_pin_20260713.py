"""Pin: a P1 MANDATORY-METRICS gate — every paid task must carry its FULL v3 metric set, and a
task that does not is fail-closed (NOT citable), per MANDATORY_METRICS.md line 1 ("A run without
its metrics is NOT done").

WHY (MANDATORY_METRICS.md §12, the v3 `gt.feature_metrics.v1` per-feature contract): the Collect
step already runs `gt_deep_metrics.py` (sections 1-11). §12 adds the per-FEATURE behavioural
contract, emitted by `scripts/swebench/gt_feature_metrics.py` into `gt_feature_metrics_<task>.json`.
Before this wave, a paid GT-on task could finish, upload, and be audited with NO feature-metrics
file and no hard stop — a run silently "not done" but treated as citable.

FIX (this file pins it), in the Collect step of swebench_live_lite_full.yml:
  1. INVOKE the v3 CLI: after the existing `gt_deep_metrics.py` line, run
     `scripts/swebench/gt_feature_metrics.py` (same PYTHONPATH pattern), copy its outputs into
     trial_results/.
  2. METRICS-COMPLETE gate (GT-on arm, GT_BASELINE!=1): after BOTH metric steps, require the full
     per-task set to exist non-empty — gt_deep_metrics_<task>.json, gt_feature_metrics_<task>.json,
     gt_profile_activation.json, gt_run_identity.json. Any missing => emit GT_METRICS_INCOMPLETE
     (tee'd to the trial log, citing MANDATORY_METRICS.md) + `exit 1`, the SAME fail-closed style as
     GT_PROFILE_UNPROVEN.
  3. BOTH arms require deep, performance-detail, and behavioral-detail metrics; GT-only proof
     artifacts remain under the GT_BASELINE guard.

WHERE the gate lives (justified): NOT in the liveness step but at the END of Collect, BECAUSE the
per-task metric artifacts are PRODUCED in Collect (the two metric CLIs run there); the liveness step
runs earlier (before the evaluator + before Collect) and cannot gate on files that do not yet exist.
Collect is `if: always()` so it runs on partial failures; its `exit 1` fails the job (fail-closed)
while the later Upload (`if: always()`) still captures every collected artifact — the same "run
captured but not citable" semantics as GT_PROFILE_UNPROVEN.

CRITICAL invariant kept green (the docker `bash -c '` block trap): the paid agent step is ONE
single-quoted `bash -c '...'`. A stray apostrophe closes the quote early and the agent silently never
launches. This gate is added to the Collect step and never touches that block; the apostrophe-parity
pin below re-asserts the block stayed quote-balanced.
