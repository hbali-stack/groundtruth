"""Process-level determinism pin for the localization PATH component (D6).

Real defect (run 29534714080, task beeware__briefcase-2075): the Stage-1 brief
determinism gate reported "independent same-input brief acquisition produced
different canonical identities" with exactly three float-valued diffs, all on the
rank-1 candidate:
    /metrics/localization_proof/0/components/path
    /metrics/localization_proof/0/path_component
    /metrics/localization_proof/0/score
The two acquisitions run in SEPARATE python processes, so ``PYTHONHASHSEED``
differs and set/dict iteration order changes. The path component is produced by
``v7_4_brief._path_prior_scores`` (formerly an inline block in ``run_v74``). Its
directory-match pass reduced over the ``_issue_words`` SET but ``break``-ed on the
FIRST set-matching word and used THAT word's idf, so two processes could select a
different word -> a different ``0.4 * idf`` -> a different path component -> a
different ``score`` (path is a weighted term of score) -> a different canonical
brief identity.

The fix takes ``max`` over ALL set-matching words per directory part (no break):
``max`` is commutative + associative + EXACT for IEEE-754 floats, so the emitted
score is a pure function of the input SET {all_files, issue_text}, independent of
set-iteration order. This aligns the directory pass with the basename pass above it
(already a ``max`` reduction).

These tests exercise the REAL producer (``_path_prior_scores``) in fresh processes
across differing hash seeds and assert BYTE-identical emitted floats. Reliably RED
on the pre-fix ``break`` (empirically 3 distinct values across seeds), GREEN on the
``max``-over-set fix. Generic paths/words only -- the invariant must hold for ANY
input (no repo/task names in the logic).
