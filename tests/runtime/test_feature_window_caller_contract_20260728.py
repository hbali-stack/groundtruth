"""C11 follow-on: the commitment window is FALSIFIABLE for `caller_contract`.

The scheduler's release test was the literal constant ``CommitmentWindowState.OPEN``, so
``release_allowed == relevant`` and timing was algebraically eliminated. ``FeatureWindow``
restores a real three-point window. ss_gate drives the real seam but cannot reach this
decision, so the window's own behaviour is asserted here and only here.

Two things must hold and are easy to get wrong:
  1. A passed window routes to HELD (recoverable), NEVER to the terminal EXPIRED.
  2. Every DIRECT contract has a registry-owned lifecycle window; CAP contracts inherit
     the window of the FACT whose bytes they own.
