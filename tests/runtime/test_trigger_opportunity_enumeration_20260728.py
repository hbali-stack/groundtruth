"""The trigger denominator must be registry-derived, and must not lose features to it.

This pins the pure enumerator that answers "which fact triggers exist, and when does each
fire".  It is the denominator for every "dark feature" claim: without it, a producer that
was never asked and a producer that is broken are the same silence.

Three properties carry the whole design, and each one is a defect I made or nearly made:

1. **The authority is ``required_event``, not ``deliver_by``.**  The registry maps
   evidence types to a class BY DECISION, not by TIMING, so eight of the registered types
   deliver at a different boundary than their class declares.  Keying on ``deliver_by``
   attributes those to the WRONG observation — manufacturing phantom opportunities and
   phantom darkness at once.  My first design did exactly this.
2. **The class name is not in its own grain.**  ``evidence_grain_for(fc)`` returns only
   the FINER identifiers.  Enumerating the grain alone gives ``submit_refusal`` and
   ``syntax_result`` — two of the 17 DIRECT — zero triggers, because their grains hold
   only producer names that do not register.
3. **Unobservable boundaries are MARKED, never omitted.**  An omitted trigger is
   indistinguishable from one nobody considered, which is the exact failure this module
   exists to remove.
