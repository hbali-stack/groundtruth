"""C17 (#19) — the layers invoked ONLY by the legacy fallback route, pinned executably.

`_augment_output` reaches `_augment_output_legacy` in exactly two situations: there is no
canonical runtime attachment, or the canonical observer has gone DARK. So these layers are the
FALLBACK ROUTE — not dead code, and not the healthy production path either. Both misreadings
cost something:

  * "never runs"      -> someone deletes a live fallback whose whole purpose is that a dark
                         observer degrades to untimed delivery rather than to silence.
  * "runs normally"   -> its counters get audited as canonical behaviour. That is how the
                         historical "137/138 wrong_phase suppressions" figure became folklore
                         about the canonical path and had to be retracted.

WHY A TEST INSTEAD OF 48 COMMENTS. A comment cannot notice when a layer is re-homed. This
pins the class so BOTH directions of drift surface:
  * a layer gains a call site outside the legacy body  -> it is no longer legacy-only, and the
    list must shrink (that is a re-homing, and it should be deliberate).
  * a new function becomes legacy-only                 -> the list must grow, forcing someone
    to decide whether that was intended.

METHOD, and its LIMIT stated honestly. Membership is decided by LOCATION of direct call sites,
not by call-graph resolution — three separate call-graph attempts produced three wrong answers
(371, a vacuous 0, and 425) because this file mixes module functions, methods and dynamic
dispatch, and attribute names collide with stdlib methods (`execute`, `add`, `observe`, `flush`
are all both).

This set is therefore FIRST-ORDER and CONSERVATIVE: functions called DIRECTLY from inside
`_augment_output_legacy` and nowhere else. A transitive callee of one of these is NOT included.
Under-reporting is the safe direction for a labelling task; over-reporting would invite deleting
something live.
