"""Byte-parity test for the two LIVE-for-DeepSWE test/demo path-filter copies.

THE DUPLICATION (the two copies that ship on the DeepSWE path; the OH/v7 ones
are out of scope here):

  * BRIEF side  -- ``src/groundtruth/pretask/v1r_brief.py::_is_test_path``
    (~451). Catches TEST dir-segments + basename test markers. MISSES demo /
    non-source dirs (examples/, docs_src/, tutorial/, fixtures/, vendor/,
    node_modules/, dist/, build/).

  * PER-TURN side -- ``artifact_deepswe/gt_mini_patch.py::_is_test_or_demo_path``
    (~362). The SUPERSET: TEST dir-segments + basename markers OR demo /
    non-source dir-segments. This is the CORRECT canonical behavior.

THE DRIFT (witnessed): because the brief copy under-catches demo dirs, the
localization candidate set leaked ``docs_src/`` files in the fastapi run
(``docs_src/tutorial001.py`` surfaced as a candidate edit target).

THE CANONICAL UNION PREDICATE (target state, == the twin's logic):

    is_test_or_demo(path) :=
        any test-dir segment in the path's DIRECTORY segments
        OR any demo/non-source dir segment in the directory segments
        OR a basename test marker (test_*, *_test.*, *.test.*, *.spec.*)

i.e. ``gt_mini_patch._is_test_or_demo_path`` is the superset and is correct;
the de-dup points BOTH call sites at one predicate with this behavior.

This test PINS that target. Rows where the brief copy currently UNDER-catches
(demo dirs) are marked ``xfail`` against the brief predicate -- they fail RED
today (documenting the drift) and FLIP GREEN (xpass) once the de-dup lands and
the brief side calls the union predicate. Read an unexpected xpass as: the
de-dup happened, delete the xfail marker.
