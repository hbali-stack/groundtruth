"""Pin: Profile-2 activation must leave a DURABLE per-task artifact + a fail-closed liveness gate.

BUG (run 29217805592): the RL-profile activation + capability receipt existed ONLY as stdout log
lines in the trial docker block. The per-task collected artifacts (everything the Collect step
gathers out of $HOST_GT_OUT = /tmp/gt_out) carried NO durable record of activation, so the section-4
auditor read the run as profile-DARK even though Profile-2 was live in-container.

FIX (this file pins it):
  1. the trial/fan-out step (the one that computes _GT_PROFILE_EXPORTS + echoes the activation
     line) ALSO writes gt_profile_activation.json into the /gt_out bind-mount (collected into the
     task artifact) -- a schema-versioned record of {profile, members, capability_receipt}.
  2. the liveness/verdict step (the AGENT_DID_NOT_RUN gate) ALSO fails closed for the GT-on arm
     (GT_BASELINE != 1) when that proof file is absent: it emits GT_PROFILE_UNPROVEN + exit 1, the
     SAME mechanism as AGENT_DID_NOT_RUN, so a GT-on task with no activation proof is never
     citable as a GT-on result.
  3. the baseline (control) arm activates no profile, so it neither writes nor requires the file
     (byte-identical control arm -- no new requirement on the control).

CRITICAL invariant (the docker bash -c ' block trap): the trial step is ONE single-quoted
`bash -c '...'` argument. A single stray apostrophe inside it closes the quote early and the
agent silently never launches. The apostrophe-parity pin below guards that the persist code did
not introduce a bare apostrophe (see its docstring for the precise limits of the check).
