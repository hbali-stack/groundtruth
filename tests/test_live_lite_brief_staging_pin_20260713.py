"""Pin the step-0 BRIEF staging into the live-mini (Live-Lite) workflow (2026-07-13).

FINDING: the step-0 GT brief (brief.txt) is baked by the substrate-proof step to the host
artifacts dir (GT_CERT_DIR, default /tmp/gt) and bind-mounted READ-ONLY into the agent
container at /gt_artifacts (the ${HOST_ARTIFACTS}:${GT_C_ARTIFACTS}:ro mount) — but nothing
forwarded its path to gt_headless_runner.py, so the runner never read it and the agent saw the
issue text alone (step-0 channel dark on every mini run).

FIX (minimal, no new mount): the brief is ALREADY visible at /gt_artifacts/brief.txt via the
existing ro mount, exactly like graph.db is forwarded as GT_HOST_GRAPH_DB=${GT_C_ARTIFACTS}/
graph.db. So the trial `docker run` forwards GT_BRIEF_FILE=${GT_C_ARTIFACTS}/brief.txt on the
`-e` list; the runner reads it (default /gt_artifacts/brief.txt) and prepends it on the GT arm.

These are DETERMINISTIC staging pins (read the workflow + the runner, assert the in-container
path the workflow forwards on GT_BRIEF_FILE equals the mount target /gt_artifacts + /brief.txt).
They mirror tests/test_live_lite_l6_staging_pin_20260712.py. No live run — Stage-1 only.

RED-first: on the pre-fix tree these FAIL (no GT_BRIEF_FILE anywhere in the mini workflow, and
the runner has no GT_BRIEF_FILE reader). The mount + GT_C_ARTIFACTS=/gt_artifacts already exist
(the graph.db forward proves the mount is a valid brief source), so only the forward + reader
are new.
