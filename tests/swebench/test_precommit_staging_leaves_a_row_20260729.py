"""Every canonical STAGING site must leave a durable compilation row — P1-3.

THE DEFECT (codex audit 2026-07-29, confirmed by reading all three call sites):
``_stage_canonical_compilation`` has three seam callers —

  * the ordinary observation path: writes the ``canonical_runtime.compilation``
    SUCCESS mirror row ("Until 2026-07-27 only the FAILED branch wrote a row…"),
  * the step-0 path: writes its own ``canonical_runtime.step0`` row,
  * the PRECOMMIT path (direct-commitment batches — the seam gives the coalition
    one chance to stage already-computed evidence before the native action):
    writes NOTHING. A capsule staged at the submit-adjacent boundary is
    indistinguishable downstream from a compilation that never happened — the
    exact "silent outcome" defect the success-mirror row was written to kill,
    reappearing at the third site.

This pins the invariant at the SOURCE level (same technique as
``test_emittable_rung_has_a_writer_20260728``): every ``_stage_canonical_compilation(``
call site must be followed, within its own basic block, by a
``_runtime_ledger_record(`` whose kind starts with ``canonical_runtime.`` — the
durable explanation of what was staged there.
