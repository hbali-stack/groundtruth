"""Pin: the paid-run agent must be launched HEADLESSLY, or every task washes to 0 steps.

BUG (run 29211807809 + micro-verify 29212976448 + micro-verify 29214296174, all 0 agent steps):
the `mini-swe-agent` console entry IS the interactive `mini` app (minisweagent.run.mini:app,
confirmed via entry_points). In a headless container it reaches import + config-load then never
calls agent.run() -- 0 steps, no trajectory. `--agent-class default` did NOT fix it (it swaps the
agent the app builds, not the app harness). The working baseline-83 / GT-on(75) ran mini-swe-agent
PROGRAMMATICALLY (pier + GTMiniSweAgent), never this CLI. FIX: gt_headless_runner.py replays the
non-interactive core of mini.py (get_model -> get_environment(local) -> get_agent(default) ->
agent.run), verified end-to-end locally with a DeterministicModel.

Two-sided pin on the trial step:
  * it MUST launch the agent via `python /opt/gt/gt_headless_runner.py` (a revert to running the
    agent through the interactive `mini-swe-agent`/`mini` CLI reddens this);
  * the GT_RUN_* env contract MUST be set, with the task -z guarded (an empty issue file must fall
    back, never launch on an empty task);
  * the runner MUST be staged into /opt/gt (else the container has nothing to run).

This pins liveness at the source: "the agent actually takes steps" becomes an assertion on HOW it
is launched, not a hope re-discovered only after a paid run returns empty.
